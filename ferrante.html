<p><b>Book miniatures: Ferrante, <i>L'amica geniale</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I finished this book over a week ago and haven’t managed to write a post yet, partly for lack of time, partly because I don’t have anything particularly meaningful to say about it. I really want to get something out tonight, so let’s just be telegraphic. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Where: a suburb of Naples, Italy. When: the post-war, post-fascist fifties. Who: two girls, Elena (our main protagonist slash narrator) and Lila (her best friend slash role model slash rival slash the centre around which Elena’s life revolves). What: growing up – family, neighbourhood, school, friends, micro-adventures, puberty, romance, finally a wedding (and only one). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What, take two: class, social mobility, gender roles. Two girls from different socioeconomic backgrounds trying to build a future for themselves in a very narrow world. Both play their cards as well as they can: Elena bets on higher education, Lila, whose family can’t afford anything but the bare minimum of schooling, on an advantageous marriage. How their strategies will pay off is, by the end of the book, still up in the air.

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What, take three: envy. Elena is pretty, but Lila is beautiful. Elena is smart, Lila brilliant. Elena is a perfectly nice and popular girl, but Lila is edgy, charming, courageous, she stuns everyone with her sheer presence and doesn’t even care. Elena leads – and, we suspect, will always lead – a life in Lila’s shadow, the life of a supporting character, someone who is always defined in relation to the real star in the room. There’s often a bitterness in Elena’s voice. What’s the point of being smart when you’re standing next to someone who is brilliant. Ferrante doesn’t even offer Elena the easy way out of a bout of envy, which is, in case you didn’t know, thinking really hard about all those ways in which you can still comfortably feel superior to your rival. Lila is superior in everything, so what’s the point of anything. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What, take four: friendship? Elena and Lila have one of those close, interpenetrating, borderline parasitic interfemale friendships that I find deeply confusing and slightly repulsive. I didn’t understand why Elena doesn’t just come to hate Lila, at least not yet. (Perhaps in the sequels, of which there are three – plenty of time for hatred). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>How: fun. Good, actually. Who would have thought.</p>
