<p><b>Book miniatures: Pamuk, <i>Snow</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>If <i>Snow</i> has one merit – and it has many –, it is the way in which it blends grim realism with whimsical magic. Pamuk’s Turkish novel from the early 2000s tells the (fictional) story of an Islamist coup against the modernist, secular, Westernized regime in the small town of Kars, located near the Armenian border and far away from Ankara. The coup is ignited by a (non-fictional) wave of suicides of young girls who are forced to remove their headscarves at school by national mandate, outraging the more conservative people of Kars. The coup is real – people die –, and yet it is a fantasy: it starts and ends as a literal theatre play, its main leader is a famous, albeit ageing stage actor, and the only reason why it lasts for even a few days is that Kars, like a magic castle, is cut off from the rest of the world by insurmountable masses of snow. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Our main protagonist and point-of-view character is a poet named Ka (and note that Ka is in Kars, and that snow in Turkish means <i>kar</i>), who visits Turkey for the first time since seeking political asylum in Germany many years ago. Which is not to say that Ka is a particularly political person. He is a soft-spoken, upper-middle-class intellectual who briefly dabbled in leftism as a university student without much enthusiasm or conviction (let alone skill) and has since abandoned politics altogether to retreat into his ivory tower of melancholic poetry. His stated reason for visiting Kars is to report on the suicide girls; the true reason is İpek, the woman he used to love and who he hopes to find in Kars. Wandering through the snowy streets of Kars like a child in a city of grown-ups, Ka longs for inspiration for poems, for İpek, for an experience of God. But eventually he finds himself, nolens volens, at the heart of the coup, between conspirators, assassins and political prisoners.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Ka is a dreamer, but he is a dreamer of the most mundane things. His vision of a future life with İpek is to bring her back with him to Frankfurt where he lives (perhaps the most mundane of all major German cities), go to the cafés, the cinemas, go to <i>Kaufhof</i>, of all places. This is his idea of happiness. Kars, with its intrigues, violence and religious fervour, is a place to escape from. The magic castle is not Kars, despite all the poems that come to Ka during his stay, despite a fleeting sense he has there that God might exist. The magic castle is Frankfurt’s <i>Kaufhof</i>. Ka’s power as a poet is not to construe an alternative reality and call it magic, but to make magic out of a reality so mundane that it cannot even be called grim.  </p>
