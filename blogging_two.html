<p><b>On blogging (vol. II)</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I have a few more thoughts about the experience of writing this blog that I wanted to get out.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Reading my own writing is, for the most part, absolutely excruciating. I can’t believe I used to think of myself as a decent writer. I can barely write a straightforward English sentence. There are certain patterns – lengthy appositions, enumerations that come in three, parentheses – that are obnoxious and pretentious but that I produce all the time, no matter how hard I try to avoid them. I suspect it’s getting worse the more I write. A couple of times already I’ve set myself the goal of writing a post in the simplest language possible, but it feels odd, like I’m wearing someone else’s clothes that don’t suit me, or like I’m trying to make myself popular. At which point the appositions and enumerations start to add up again and I’m back where I started. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Last year I discovered ecstatic dance. At an ecstatic dance event any form of movement is allowed and encouraged; drugs, phones and talking are banned. It’s awesome, for the most part. Ecstatic dance is emphatically not a performance; it’s meant to be a space where you don’t have to feel judged or judge yourself, but judgments are hard to ban. Sometimes I feel I’m stuck in certain patterns of movement that are trite and unimaginative, and then I abruptly try to change the way I dance and do something more interesting. It doesn’t work; I just end up feeling weird and awkward. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What does work: dancing such a pattern to death, repeating it over and over again until it becomes something else. You can’t run away from it; the only way out is through. If you do consciously try something else, do it consciously for real, don’t pretend it’s natural. Focus on the weirdness, make it weirder and weirder, make the weirdness the whole point of it. Don’t try to hide your trying. In <i>Infinite Jest</i>, there is a self-help group of sorts called the Union of the Hideously and Improbably Deformed (U.H.I.D.) whose members wear veils to hide their hideously and improbably deformed faces. Someone explains the logic behind the practice as follows: we’re ashamed of how we look, but we no longer want to be ashamed of the fact that we are ashamed, of which we would then, in turn, be ashamed, etc., all of which adds up to an uncontrollable amount of shame. Wearing a veil means being open about being ashamed. Beware of the recursive spiral. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What this means for writing: don’t try to sound natural. Don’t pretend this is easy. Do try weird things. Imitate, emulate and parody others. Imitate, emulate and parody yourself. In Greco-Roman antiquity, a key part of rhetorical training was learning to write from the perspective of someone very different from yourself, be it Achilles, a slave, a woman or a rock. If you’re unconvincing as a rock, that’s on you. The idea of finding your own voice, or that you can only write authentically about something you have experienced first-hand, is a very recent one. Instead of trying to cultivate your own unique style, it might be more interesting to define and embrace the set of your own particular shortcomings in imitating others as your style. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I never meant for this blog to be a record for posterity or anything, but I’ve started to think of it as the opposite, something whose purpose is to be deleted. Things need to come out and be verbalized and then they’re done. It’s happened to me that I’ve wanted to write about something, but by the time I actually got to it, I realized it wasn’t important anymore. I’m trying to empty myself more and more, writing things down to get rid of them. The only way out is through.</p>
