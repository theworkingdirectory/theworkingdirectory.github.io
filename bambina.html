<p><b>Book miniatures: Ferrante, <i>Storia della bambina perduta</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’m moderately overworked these days and can’t be bothered to get more than the bare minimum of posting done. (I’ve actually switched to longer books by now so I have less writing to do, which I think is a very smart choice.)</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The fourth volume, the last one, the volume to end all volumes. I can’t remember the last time I spent so many hours with a novel’s protagonist, or when was the last time I saw a whole life play out before my eyes, from childhood to old age. It strikes you how much a single life is, and how little at the same time. So many things that happen, and even more that don’t. 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>When you’re young, or at least when you’re me being young, you think that at some point in life you’ll reach a state of equilibrium that you’ll just stay in until you die. As a child, I could not imagine my grandparents getting any older than they already were. In my earliest memories, they must have been in their sixties, which isn’t too old, but they were retired, wore beige clothes, watched the kinds of TV channels that only old people watch and, most importantly, were my grandparents. I figured they would just stay old, and then one day they would die. Turns out that growing old doesn’t work like that, and that being sixty-old and being ninety-old are very different things, which is arguably obvious, but not for someone who has just hit their thirties. What is most fascinating about watching Ferrante’s characters grow up and grow old is seeing that life always moves them to new places that neither they nor we ever expected, which makes you weirdly excited, if not to say slightly giddy, about having a life yourself.  </p>
