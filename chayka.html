<p><b>Book miniatures: Chayka, <i>The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’m writing this on the eve of the start of term. I will have less time over the next few weeks, so I decided to get this out tonight without trying to come to any sort of conclusion. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I came across Chayka when I was looking for a book about Minimalism and realized that the world is drowning in books about minimalism. <i>The Longing for Less</i> is a book about both, the 20th century art movement as well as the contemporary lifestyle trend, Agnes Martin as well as Marie Kondo. Although Chayka draws connections between the two, he also sees them as opposites in many ways. For him, Minimalism sought to eliminate clutter and distraction in order to intensify the experience of the world; it had an almost spiritual quality. It stripped away the superficial to see the essential more clearly, but it did so by being deliberately disruptive, by upsetting our default mode of perception. By contrast, minimalism promises to make life easier, smoother, more frictionless. At best, it gives you the peace of mind that comes with a well-organized closet, at worst, it simply sells a certain aesthetic.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>As trite as the distinction between high art and its commercialized offshoots is in principle, I don’t criticize Chayka for the value judgement he makes. I do, however, wish he’d help me better understand the connection between the two. Why does Minimalism turn into minimalism, and what is it that makes minimalism attractive today? You could argue that it doesn’t matter. In the same way that an artist can turn anything into art, a capitalist can turn anything into capital, and each prefers to operate on the output of the other: art becomes commodity becomes art becomes commodity. Content is irrelevant; everything can be art and everything can be sold, and minimalism is simply what Minimalism becomes when it enters the marketplace. It becomes, to borrow a phrase I read once but can’t remember where, yet another signifier of personal identity.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But then the fact remains that what attracts people to minimalism is more than just the aesthetics of white T-shirts and ikebana. Chayka talks a lot about the urge to simplify our lives in an increasingly complex and unmanageable world. Between economic uncertainty, the insane politics of the first Trump presidency and, not least, this thing called the internet, a well-organized closet can feel like the only space where you can exercise some control. Minimalism, even in its commercialized lower-case variant, still meets a genuine demand. Its rise maps onto the fall of The world as we know it. It’s not an unreasonable narrative, and yet I was somehow hoping for something else.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I was a minimalist before it was cool. Few things in life give me such simple and immediate satisfaction as I get from reducing and organizing my possessions. I have found myself getting up in the middle of the night because I couldn’t resist the urge to find at least one or two items to get rid of. Reading <i>The Longing for Less</i> triggered a four-hour decluttering frenzy, during which, among other things, I reorganized the drawers of my desk in a way that felt life-changing and that still fills me with bliss. I’m not experiencing economic uncertainty, the even more insane second Trump presidency hardly affects me personally, and I don’t really understand the internet anyway. I have a ridiculous amount of privilege, my mental health is very solid, and yet my behavior would clearly qualify as compulsive if it weren’t for the fact that, apart from a few hours of lost sleep here and there, it doesn’t really affect my life in any negative way. I suppose I was hoping Chayka would tell me that my mundane obsession is actually connected in some profound and meaningful way to Agnes Martin and John Cage, and the fact that he doesn’t is a bummer. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is a passage in <i>Walden</i> where Thoreau lists in painstaking detail every single piece of furniture he owns, which is, of course, exactly the right amount of furniture to own. (He goes on to tell us that an old woman once offered him a mat. He refused, of course, because – and I’m quoting imperfectly from memory here, but it’s pretty close – <i>one must resist evil at its root</i>.) I have certainly indulged in listing the things I own. For both Thoreau and me, what seems at first to be an anti-materialist attitude ends up being an obsession with objects. The real purpose of decluttering isn’t to minimize attachment to material possessions but to maximize control. A smaller set of objects is simply easier to monitor and keep in check. And I might just as well end by saying that minimalism, at least in some of its variants, isn't a longing for less but a longing for more: more control, more order, more power, more structure, more totality. It's about tightening your grip rather than letting go. </p>
