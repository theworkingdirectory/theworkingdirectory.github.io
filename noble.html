<p><b>Book miniatures: Noble, <i>The Music of Life</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This was a recommendation from a podcast [note to self: write blog post about favourite podcasts] which turned out to connect with a bunch of things that are on my mind a lot these days: abstraction, levels of explanation, the self. (Apologies for excessive parenthesizing in the following.)</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>A good starting point for explaining what keeps Noble up at night is Dawkin’s in-/famous theory of the selfish gene according to which the actors (for lack of a better word) of evolution aren’t whole organisms such as you and me but rather genes themselves. What genes care about (very metaphorically speaking – this is not an anthropomorphic view) is their own survival and reproduction, for which the survival and reproduction of the organism is merely a vehicle. A gene is like a virus which avoids killing the organism it has infiltrated for the simple reason that a dead body is an inconvenient habitat and also makes it kind of difficult for the virus to get around and keep on spreading. Fine, says Noble, but if you want to tell the story of evolution with genes as its protagonists, don’t stop at individual selection. Leaving aside kin selection (which apparently is a thing with genes but I’m not very clear on how it works) and sexual selection (which most likely isn’t a thing with genes), Noble points out that genes also engage in reciprocal altruism, the kind of I-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine behavior that in the short term reduces fitness but, if the calculation works out, pays off in the long term. In other words, if genes want to survive and reproduce, they need to cooperate with each other, and high-level cooperation between genes is simply what you call an organism, something like you and me. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To draw an analogy that Noble doesn’t draw himself but that I’m reasonably sure he wouldn’t complain about, explaining biology exclusively in terms of the genome and reducing it to molecular biology falls short in the same way as explaining society exclusively in terms of individuals and reducing it to psychology. It is true that from a certain perspective, society is composed of individuals, which are nothing but organisms, which consist of molecules, which in turn are built from smaller particles, but it doesn’t follow that every level of explanation above particle physics is redundant and ought to be done away with. Each higher level gives rise to emergent properties. What Noble is concerned with in his research, and what large parts of <i>The Music of Life</i> are devoted to, are biological processes such as the heartbeat which constitute precisely such emergent properties in that they are irreducible to a single molecular mechanism and require a system-level account. Noble also questions the dogma that causation only flows one way, bottom-up, instead making the case for downward causation and feedback loops through which the higher levels come to affect the lower levels: individuals shape society; society shapes individuals. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Noble ends <i>The Music of Life</i> with a chapter about the self, mercilessly ridiculing the idea that there is something inside of us, something small, a proper subset of us, that can be called the self (the homunculus, the pineal gland, etc.). In his view, the self is, like the heartbeat, an emergent property that cannot even be made sense of below the level of the organism as a whole. To draw yet another analogy Noble could have drawn but didn’t, heat is a property that only exists above a certain level: heat is generated through friction between particles that are in motion; accordingly, a single particle doesn’t have a temperature. Trying to identify the specific part of the brain that is the locus of the self is like trying to identify the specific particle in a molecular soup that contributes the heat. There is a passage in an essay by Bateson that god/God is nothing but the name we give to the world-mind, the system comprised of all living, thinking and feeling beings, or perhaps of all beings tout court, the highest-level explanation imaginable (essentially good old fashioned pantheism framed in system-theoretic terms). What makes this idea difficult to wrap our head around is our persistent bias to consider ourselves whole, homogeneous entities but see everything that we are a part of as merely a discontinuous set that isn’t really a <i>thing</i> properly speaking (cf. the idea that society does not exist). If Noble is right, however, we are already gods, something that our cells would have a hard time wrapping their nucleus around. We are not a <i>thing</i>, we are emergent properties, and we can only be reasonably said to exist from the perspective of a very specific level of explanation. </p>
