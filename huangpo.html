<p><b>Book miniatures: Blofield (ed.), <i>The Zen Teaching of Huang Po</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Zen is very simple. Don’t do anything. Don’t think. Avoid intellectual activity by all means. Don’t study the scriptures, don’t listen to teachings (unless by a Zen teacher), don’t ponder whether to follow this Buddhist school or that (just follow Zen). Don’t bother about compassion, good deeds, all of that nonsense that will just tie you further to this world. Above all, don’t try. Don’t seek enlightenment. If it comes, it will come all of a sudden, and only because you have given up on anything that your mind could cling to. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The book contains both lectures by Huang Po and dialogues between him and his students. It is in the latter sections that you really get a sense of the nature of Zen teaching, or at least of Huang Po’s personal style. The following excerpt is a good example of it.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Q: What guidance does Your Reverence offer to those of us who find all of this very difficult to understand?</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>A: I have NO THING to offer. I have never had anything to offer others. It is because you allow certain people to lead you astray that you are forever SEEKING intution and SEARCHING for understanding. […] All you need to remember are the following injunctions: </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>(The next four paragraphs are in all caps, which I don’t reproduce because I don’t want my readers to feel like I’m shouting at them.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>First, learn how to be entirely unreceptive to sensations arising from external forms, thereby purging your bodies of receptivity to externals.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Second, learn not to pay attention to any distinctions between this and that arising from your sensations, thereby purging your bodies of useless discernments between one phenomenon and another. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Third, take great care to avoid discriminating in terms of pleasant and unpleasant sensations, thereby purging your bodies of vain discriminations.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Fourth, avoid pondering things in your mind, thereby purging your bodies of discriminatory cognition.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Huang Po, or at least his translator, loves all caps. At some point, he uses three exclamation marks, which I think I’ve never seen in a printed book before. In the dialogues, he mostly expresses exasparation that his students are STILL clinging to conceptual thought. It is VERY SIMPLE. You just need to STOP THINKING and FEELING.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s very entertaining, but the question does arise what the point of it all is. Blofield, who occasionally explicates Huang Po’s teachings in footnotes, rephrases one of the questions he directs at his students as follows: <i>Why join this assembly to study Zen-liberation, unless the frustration set up by saṃsāric life is painful to you?</i> Zen is basically spiritual euthanasia. The only reason why one would embrace it is because existence has become unbearable. For better or for worse, my own saṃsāric life is actually okay and I’m not yet ready to die. I was genuinely interested in Zen for a while, but after reading Huang Po, I’m not entirely sure I still am.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’ve been wondering what caused this change of mind. I had always considered Buddhism more of a borderline case of a religion, something that isn’t about following a dogmatic belief, but about understanding the workings of your mind. I used to go to a Buddhist meditation center downtown and didn’t really consider this a religious or even spiritual activity. It was just kind of interesting. Until I started wondering why I was bowing to statues and singing chants devoted to some figures in the center’s spiritual lineage and generally involved in a bona fide organized religion. I could just as well have gone to church. I fully understand and appreciate that organized religions mean a great deal to many people, I respect that and I don’t think that atheism is even from a rational point of view necessarily a superior lifestyle, but if I bow to anything I’d like to have a good reason for it, and I didn’t. I still find some aspects of Buddhism interesting (see the previous post), but I’m very hesitant to let it tell me how to lead my life. Huang Po would yell at me that I need to stop clinging to my own rationality and thinking that I have it all figured out and just LET GO. But actually, I think I’m good.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There’s one more passage in this book that I wanted to highlight, partly because it’s another great example of Huang Po’s inimitable style, partly because I suspect it might get at another reason why I was/am drawn to Buddhism. It describes the moment of enlightenment:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Then will the Buddhas of all the vast world-systems manifest themselves to you in a flash; you will recognize the hosts of squirming, wriggling sentient beings as no more than shadows! Continents as innumerable as grains of dust will seem no more to you than a single drop in the great ocean.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Coming to see this world as nothing other than an insignificant illusion is power. It’s like realizing that the kids who you unsuccessfully tried to make friends with in middle school now all have very boring lives and that their approval means nothing. It means that you’re above everything, not only other people, but existence itself. It’s certainly something one might cling to. </p>
