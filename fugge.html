<p><b>Book miniatures: Ferrante, <i>Storia di chi fugge e di chi resta</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Elena and Lila are back in the third volume of Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels, which covers the period from their late twenties to their early thirties. Over the course of the book, Elena establishes herself as a successful writer, marries an equally successful academic from a well-connected family, moves to Florence and has two daughters. She has, for all intents and purposes, made it. Meanwhile, Lila enjoys some professional success of her own as an IT specialist, but her star seems to be waning. She is ageing faster than Elena. Her son turns out to be a mess. She remains confined to the neighbourhood where she and Elena grew up. Eventually, she accepts a job offer from the local Camorra boss she has despised all along – whether this is a sign of defeat or whether Lila has yet another trick up her sleeve remains to be seen. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Behind the scenes, Elena’s life isn’t all roses either. While her first novel was well received, she struggles to build on its success, and motherhood makes it all but impossible for her to pursue her professional ambitions to the fullest. Her husband turns out to be a distant and unsociable fellow who has no interest in her being anything other than an obedient homemaker. Their love life is unsatisfying, to say the least. But nonetheless, Elena is increasingly taking center stage in the novel. While in the first volume, she seemed to be a supporting character in her own life, perpetually in Lila’s shadow, she now more and more has a story of her own to tell. She emerges as a mature, confident and thoughtful woman who is able to reflect on her own position in society, all against the backdrop of the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And then in a final twist, Nino reappears. Nino, Elena’s long-time crush, who in the second volume became Lila’s lover, only to abandon her after a few months under pressure from his family. He is by now married and has a child with his wife, but when he and Elena meet again, they fall for each other and it is all or nothing. Both abandon their spouses and at the end of the novel, they find themselves on the brink of a new life. I wrote in a previous post that while Elena’s account of Lila’s life reads like a novel, that of her own reads like a documentary. But now the roles have switched, and it is Elena who gets to experience the major upheavals, the momentous decisions, the big emotions of a novel. Is this empowering, the ultimate emancipation, taking her life in her own hands? Or is she falling prey to a narrative that promises redemption through romantic love, but ultimately proves deceptive? Volume 4 coming up soon. </p>
