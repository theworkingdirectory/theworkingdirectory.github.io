<p><b>Book miniatures: Lewis, <i>Mere Christianity</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I feel the need to begin this post by explaining why I currently read so much about religion. It’s not that I’m craving some sort of spiritual epiphany or looking for a faith-based community to join. What I find so fascinating about religious beliefs is mostly the fact that I simply can’t understand why anyone would hold them. I don’t mean to say that I find religious beliefs as such outrageous or harmful or dangerous or anything of that kind, and I fully acknowledge that many people lead more meaningful and wholesome lives because of their faith. Others don’t, but that’s not the point here. The point is that I really don’t understand; that I don’t see why anyone would subscribe to Christianity or Islam or whatever. (I know I already explained this to some extent in a previous post, but it bears repeating.) There are plenty of beliefs that I don’t agree with, but which I nonetheless understand. I’m not pro-life, but I see why someone would be. But with religion, I just don’t see it. So what’s interesting here is really the epistemology of all of it, for lack of a better term. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Turning to Lewis (yes, the <i>Narnia</i> guy), <i>Mere Christianity</i> is a book whose goal – and Lewis is perfectly frank about this – is to convert its readers to Christianity. The first two chapters set out a simple argument for the existence of God, based on the observation that all human beings acknowledge some idea of good and evil but also acknowledge that they themselves fail to adhere to their own standard of goodness, which shows that there must be some higher power that is the origin of goodness, etc. (While writing this, I realize that I can’t even be bothered to spell out, or try to fully understand, Lewis’s complete chain of reasoning here, which is odd given that I read this book precisely with the goal of understanding people’s reasoning in this respect. It’s like I understand Christian faith so little that I don’t even see why I would try to understand it.) The next, much longer chapter provides an overview over Christian morality, while the final chapter gets into the theological weeds of things with a discussion of the Trinity.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s easy to complain about <i>Mere Christianity</i>. Lewis’s views on vices and virtues are steeped in mid-20th-century conservatism. The section on Christian marriage somehow manages to be even more awful than you would think it is, and I am very tempted to quote from it at length to prove my point and to make fun of it, but it’s gratuitous and so I won’t. I think I do actually understand why anyone would think about morality in this way, but I understand it in a kind of Nietzschean way, in that I see which unpleasant facts about the human psyche these stories would be meant to cover up, which is not an interesting kind of understanding. There is also the fact that Lewis likes to speak of Christianity in parables (preferably drawn from either digestion or World War II), but analogies are not arguments, and I repeatedly ran against what felt like complete non-sequiturs. It’s hard to argue with someone with whom you have so little common ground. (As a side note, I even find it hard to argue with people who work in slightly different theories of syntax than I do, and I don’t even mean CCG or HPSG or something, but even 90s-style projectionism, which is after all a mainstream generative theory and still feels like a world away from what I’m doing. Anyways.) You need to agree with people on many things before you can meaningfully disagree with them. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>However, there is something compelling in this book, which I find hard to articulate. I’ll say that it is the vision of a life that is devoted to being good. Not for material rewards, not for the promise of eternal life, not for your mental health, just for its own sake. You might not know what this good is, but you know that it exists and that it is your responsibility to find it. And this knowledge is deeply scary and yet the greatest relief you could feel. It’s like a breath of fresh air. I don’t really see how you get from there to God, but I suspect there’s a connection somewhere. </p>
