<p><b>Book miniatures: Pessoa, <i>The Keeper of Sheep</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I read the translation by Edwin Honig and Susan M. Brown. It was technically a bilingual edition but I’m not going to pretend that I speak Portuguese, so I won’t quote the original.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I remember reading Feyerabend’s <i>Against Method</i> a couple of years ago and falling in love with it immediately. It was one of those books that says exactly the things you’ve always wanted to say but never found the words to say. It was terrific, but only until I hit the last chapter, in which Feyerabend triumphantly concludes that all of this is why it should be allowed to teach creationism in schools. Which, I couldn’t help but agree, does indeed seem to follow from his argument that I so wholeheartedly endorsed, but I very much didn’t want it to follow. I ended up feeling somehow betrayed, as if I had been given a box of chocolates, started to munch, and suddenly found a cockroach among them. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So Pessoa turned out to be another one of those. I had never read him before but picked up <i>The Keeper of Sheep</i> after hearing it quoted on a Heidegger podcast. It said exactly the things I didn’t even know I’d always wanted to say but wanted to say anyway. Here’s an excerpt from <i>The mystery of things, where is it</i>: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Because the only hidden meaning of things </i> </p>
<p><i>Is that they have no hidden meaning at all.  </i></p>
<p><i>This is stranger than all the strangeness,</i> </p>
<p><i>And the dreams of all the poets,</i> </p>
<p><i>And the thoughts of all the philosophers – </i> </p>
<p><i>That things really are what they appear to be </i></p>
<p><i>And that there is nothing to understand. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s Madhyamaka-style emptiness in its purest form. There is no deeper truth, no purer reality hidden beneath the surface. The mystery is that there is no mystery; the essence of things is that they have only a surface. Every page of <i>The Keeper of Sheep</i> is an ode to nature as it is, to trees as trees, flowers as flowers, rivers as rivers. Nature is nothing other than nature, it is not a metaphor or a stand-in for anything. Nature isn’t even strictly speaking nature. It is just trees and flowers and rivers. Nature is just <i>there</i>, and to truly feel its there-ness is the highest experience we can aspire to. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In short, it’s terrific. But then, on the last couple of pages, I came across <i>Yesterday afternoon a city man</i>, which is perhaps the only poem in <i>The Keeper of Sheep</i> that features a human being other than the speaker himself. This human being is a socialist who the speaker meets in an inn somwhere and who lectures him at length about the plight of the working class, about poverty and injustice. Pessoa/Caeiro is not moved: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>What does mankind matter to me </i></p>
<p><i>And what they suffer or think they suffer? </i> </p>
<p><i>Let them be like me – they won’t suffer.</i> </p>
<p><i>All the world’s troubles come from poking our noses in one another’s business,</i> </p>
<p><i>Whether to do good or to do bad.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The idea is clear: meddling in politics only makes you unhappy, every man for himself, and all those who suffer are responsible for it themselves. Why don’t they live like Pessoa? Why don’t they spend their days walking in the woods and writing poems about trees? Why do they worry about things like poverty and injustice? Why don’t they eat cake? It’s terrible, I can’t even be bothered to explain why, and I feel betrayed.  </p>
