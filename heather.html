<p><b>Book miniatures: Heather, <i>Empires and Barbarians</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>In my defence: when I ordered <i>Empires and Barbarians</i> from the library, I didn’t know it was 600 pages long. Although I should have known. What Heather is going for is nothing less than a borderline-exhaustive history of migration in Europe during the first millennium. I admit that I pretty much skipped the last three chapters, but here’s the gist of the story. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Prelude: once upon a time, the primary cause of the fall of the Roman Empire was believed to be the famous <i>Völkerwanderung</i>, i.e., the mass migration of Northern and Eastern European peoples (Goths, Vandals, Huns…) across the Roman borders, which ended up destabilizing the regime. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the <i>Völkerwanderung</i> narrative was closely associated with the national mythologies that were en vogue at the time, with many young nation states tracing their origins back to one of the groups of invading barbarians that brought down mighty Rome. Since the second half of the 20th century, this narrative has faced a backlash. Nowadays, most historians argue that late antiquity did not see an increase in entire peoples on the move, but rather the development of highly mobile barbarian armies whose goal in crossing the borders of the Empire was raiding rather than resettlement. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Heather is advocating for a back-backlash, not for a return to the <i>Völkerwanderung</i> lore of old, but for some sort of Hegelian synthesis. <i>Empires and Barbarians</i> makes the case, in painstaking detail, that late antiquity did in fact see genuine mass migration, contrary to revisionist claims. Heather agrees that migrant groups were far less ethnically homogeneous than was believed during the heyday of nationalism. Moreover, it is true that many of the cultural changes in the late Roman Empire that show up in the archaeological record – in burial rites, weaponry, dress, etc. – are due to the peoples inhabiting the Empire adopting the culture of the invading barbarians rather than being evidence of straightforward ethnic cleansing. Nevertheless, Heather argues, the migrants were not just armies; they included women and children. They were numerous and powerful, and their effect on the late Roman Empire was profound. What makes this story genuinely compelling is that throughout <i>Empires and Barbarians</i>, Heather draws connections and parallels to modern migration studies. He shows that the seemingly apocalyptic invasion of outsiders is better understood as a gradual development, driven by the same factors that have always determined, and always will determine, the movement of people across the surface of this planet. </p>
