<p><b>Book miniatures: Xingjian, <i>Soul Mountain</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Reading <i>Soul Mountain</i> was a journey. I went from finding it mildly boring to believing that it is the only novel anyone can write these days, and now that it is written, there is really no need for any other novels. If it is a novel, which is questionable. We live in an age, it says, when ‘everything to be sung or shouted has already been sung or shouted. What remains is simply typeset, printed, and called impressions.’ Xingjian is a Chinese author, more of a playwright than a novelist, a government dissident who is now in exile. In the 1980s, he was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer, only to later find out that the diagnosis was an error. He would live. <i>Soul Mountain</i> is a semi-autobiographical text about a long journey around China that he undertook after this Dostoevskyan experience. Some chapters are written in the first person, some in the second, some in the third. As the narrator explains, while he was all alone on the road, he felt the need to have someone to talk to, so ‘I’ became ‘you’, and then this ‘you’ in turn needed someone else to talk to, which was ‘she’. It’s that sort of book. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But it is not a stylistic gimmick. This is a book which is all about being alone, or rather, about the need to be alone and the inability to do so. On some level, ‘I’ is a spiritual seeker, a wanderer, on a pilgrimage to a place beyond time. On another, he is a tourist, coming straight out of a Lonely Planet guide, a sightseer looking for a form of humanity fashionably untarnished by civilization. He seeks, as he puts it, a ‘primitive loneliness devoid of all meaning.’ He finds it, and it turns out to be lonely and devoid of meaning. He gains entrance to a Daoist temple hidden deep in the mountains where he studies ancient scriptures, and then he becomes bored and leaves. No matter how strong  his desire for loneliness and non-being is, the desire evaporates once it is met, and he is pushed onwards. ‘I know there is no cure for me.’ There is no solution, and abandoning the quest for a solution is none either. </p>
