<p><b>Book miniatures: Schopenhauer, <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (vol. II)</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>In Mann’s novel <i>Buddenbrooks</i>, there is a scene in which the very down-to-earth, matter-of-fact Protestant merchant Thomas comes across a philosophical treatise in his library late at night and, having nothing else to do, begins to read. Unexpectedly, he experiences nothing less than an intellectual and spiritual revelation. Completely captivated, he rushes through the pages, often skimming or skipping whole paragraphs, trying to absorb as much wisdom as possible. When it is finally time to go to bed, he staggers off with the firm intention of returning the next day to continue his reading, more methodically this time. But the next day is busy, and the day after that he has more important things to do. Of course, he never goes back to finish his reading, and eventually comes to think of the episode only with a vague sense of embarrassment. The text in which he became intermittently ensnared is widely identified as the second volume of Schopenhauer’s <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I decided to follow Thomas’s example and not read the second part in full. Schopenhauer would have hated me for it. He writes: <i>Ueberhaupt mache ich die Anforderung, daß wer sich mit meiner Philosophie bekannt machen will, jede Zeile von mir lese</i> (in general, I demand [sic] that whoever wants to become acquainted with my philosophy must read every single line of it), a demand which, he claims, is all the more appropriate since he writes only very little and never repeats himself. Of all the wild ideas in this book, this is the most outrageous lie. The second volume is over 500 pages long and repetitive as hell. For the most part, Schopenhauer treats us to the same ideas he already lectured us on at length in the first volume: the world as we perceive it is only a representation, not to be confused with the thing in itself, life is miserable, and Hegel is a moron. Nevertheless, I shall condescend to say a few more words about this book, very concisely and without ever repeating myself.  </p>

<p><i> Wissenschaft</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>A quick note on translation: the German term <i>Wissenschaft</i> roughly means science, but it also includes the quote-unquote soft sciences such as sociology and even the humanities. Essentially, <i>Wissenschaft</i> is a field of knowledge that is systematically organized according to the rules of Western academic discourse. In the interest of not being excessively obnoxious, I’m going to call it science. Schopenhauer’s perspective on science is summarized quite neatly in the following passage: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Die Vollkommenheit einer Wissenschaft als solcher, d.h. der Form nach, besteht darin, daß so viel wie möglich Subordination und wenig Koordination der Sätze sei. Das allgemein wissenschaftliche Talent ist demnach die Fähigkeit, die Begriffssphären nach ihren verschiedenen Bestimmungen zu subordinieren, damit [...] nicht bloß ein Allgemeines und unmittelbar unter diesem eine unübersehbare Mannigfaltigkeit neben einander gestellt die Wissenschaft ausmache, sondern vom Allgemeinen zum Besonderen die Kenntniß allmälig herabschreit, durch Mittelbegriffe [...]. Eben daraus aber, daß dieses die eigentliche wissenschaftliche Vollkommenheit ausmacht, ergiebt sich, daß der Zweck der Wissenschaft nicht größere Gewißheit ist [...]; sondern Erleichterung des Wissens durch die Form desselben [...].</i>  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The perfection of a science as such, that is, in terms of form, consists in being as much as possible subordination and as little as possible coordination of propositions. General aptitude in science is therefore the ability to subordinate conceptual spheres on the basis of their definitions, so that [...] there is not just the universal and immediately below a chaotic multitude of particulars juxtaposed without any order. Rather, understanding should gradually descend from the general to the particular, through intermediate concepts [...]. The fact that this constitutes actual scientific perfection entails that the goal of science is not greater certainty [...], but the facilitation of knowledge through its form [...].  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Since Schopenhauer denies that we can truly know reality through sense perception, the goal of science cannot be true knowledge of reality. Instead, to do science is simply to arrange and rearrange concepts in hierarchical and nested orders. At the same time, Schopenhauer is deeply hostile to logical proof. The best evidence, he argues, is our immediate intuition, and knowing a fact directly is preferable to deducing it from another, previously established fact. A whole chapter is devoted to the idea that in geometry, proofs that appeal to our direct perception are far superior to those that derive a proposition from an axiom. I was wondering if there isn’t a tension here: on the one hand side, Schopenhauer wants scientists to relate concepts to other concepts and not to be caught up in the illusion that they can relate concepts to the world, but he also regards knowledge that is gained by relating one proposition to another – as opposed to being grounded in some primordial intuition – as superficial and derivative.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The problem here is arguably that Schopenhauer wants to have his cake and eat it too. On the one hand side, he cannot grant the subject any direct access to objective reality. On the other hand, this raises the question of how we ever come to have knowledge of objective reality – that is, of the nature of the thing in itself, which is the will. Schopenhauer does engage in some non-trivial discussion of this question which is reminiscent of some later developments in phenomenology, but the fact remains that he must ultimately appeal to our direct, intuitive understanding. We just <i>know</i> that the thing in itself is the will. Those who don’t are simply morons. I’m very sympathetic to the idea that philosophical theories should appeal to our concrete lived experience, but you easily end up in an argumentative cul-de-sac where both sides are just shouting ‘no it isn’t’ and ‘yes it is’ at each other, and this feels very much like such a case. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Feet </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’m happy to admit that I don’t give Schopenhauer enough credit, especially for those of his views that have by now become mainstream but very much weren’t at the time he was writing. One of them is the idea that philosophers shouldn’t think of human beings as abstract vessels for rational thought who ponder whether snow is white and grass is green and whether God exists, but rather as messy, fleshy, instinct-driven creatures who devote most of their time to the famous four Fs of animal life, i.e., feeding, fighting, fleeing and sexual reproduction. The intellect, far from being at the centre of human nature, is relegated to a marginal role, subordinated to the will. According to Schopenhauer, we are not primarily rational animals with some unfortunate emotional baggage, but we are primarily animals <i>tout court</i> who occasionally engage in some reasoning when they have nothing else to do. Notably, all of this predates not only Nietzsche and Freud but also Darwin. (Fun fact: the third and final edition of<i> Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i> was published in 1859, in the same year as <i>On the Origin of Species</i>.)   </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In a generally hilarious chapter on the metaphysics of sex, Schopenhauer even makes the case that the physical characteristics we are attracted to in others are those that correlate with reproductive success, such as youth, good teeth, a healthy complexion, etc. Note that Schopenhauer doesn’t argue for individual selection in the contemporary sense. The point is not that we want to reproduce, but that the will wants to keep the human race going so that it can keep on willing. Think <i>The Selfish Will</i>. It’s all a bit obscure but essentially boils down to species selection. Be that as it may, Schopenhauer goes on to triumphantly conclude that this is also why we are attracted to women with small feet. The reader learns that the human foot is apparently anatomically unique in the animal kingdom in that two particular bones, whose names I can’t remember, are closer together than in any other species. The will, as part of its larger interest in the continuation of the human race, wants to preserve this particular feature, and therefore makes men desire women with small feet.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’m not sure if the reader is aware of the enormous role played by women’s feet in 18th and 19th century literature. A list of desirable female attributes from that period typically includes various aspects of the face, a white neck and arms, and small feet. But admiring women’s feet has somehow gone out of fashion. For Schopenhauer, it seems to have been obvious that men lose their minds over certain types of feet, but today this is considered a fetish. I wonder what happened. Were men never really attracted to feet? Was it just a euphemism? Or is it that feet no longer get the attention they deserve because other parts of the body, all covered up in Schopenhauer’s time, steal the show? Or are the foot lovers still out there, but in hiding? And why does the will care about feet so much? If you think you have answers for me, let me know. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Non-non-self</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>One of the key ideas that Schopenhauer took from the Vedas – apologies, let me rephrase: one of the key ideas that Schopenhauer developed all by himself and only later, to his surprise, accidentally also discovered in the Vedas – is that the representational world is in constant flux. Everything changes, everything <i>is</i> change; nothing persists. We cling to things, we try to hold on to something, anything, but the wheel of samsara moves on mercilessly. If you attach value to health, youth, beauty or wealth, you will eventually be disappointed because all worldly goods inevitably fade and decay. There is no happiness to be found within this world. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>At the same time, however, Schopenhauer is an ardent Platonist, and as such he does believe in something that persists, namely, the realm of ideas. While acknowledging that reality as we see it is transient, he invents another, underlying reality that is eternal. A rose blossoms and wilts in a few days, but the idea of the rose cannot fade. Everything <i>seems</i> to be changing all the time, but in reality nothing is. It’s Heraclitus on the surface with a Parmenidean core. This is where Schopenhauer diverges from a more radical notion of emptiness or non-self developed in some branches of Buddhism according to which nothing, truly nothing persists, and where the only underlying reality is the fact that there is no underlying reality. I can’t help feeling that Schopenhauer didn’t go all the way, that he somehow smuggled his Western worldview back in through the back door. He needed something to hold on to after all.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Death </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Given that, if I may repeat myself repeating Schopenhauer, we are thus all underlyingly the will and nothing but the will so help us God, it follows that we cannot die. Of course our outward form, our humble garment of flesh, perishes in due course, but we live on in the will – unless we opt out, by renouncing worldly goods, practising asceticism and negating the will to live. But death is not the end; the will wills on. Human existence is like a tenure-track job. You can’t be fired, but you can resign.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So there is no reason to fear death. Anyone who is afraid of dying hasn’t yet fully internalized Schopenhauer’s incessant refrain that the thing that dies is not you. You are the will, and the will never dies. Of course, the basic argument that we live on in <i>some</i> way after our personal demise can be, and has been, made on all sorts of grounds. We live on in our children, in our work, in the change that our actions have brought about. As our dead bodies disintegrate, our molecules become part of other life forms. The New York Times even ran an article a few years ago discussing how people without children can still feel they have left a mark in the world that continues after they die. (One of the suggestions: just set up a private foundation!) It is easy to understand intellectually that we are part of a larger system, whatever it is. The hard part is to start caring about it. </p>
