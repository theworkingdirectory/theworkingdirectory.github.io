<p><b>Book miniatures: Joyce, <i>Dubliners</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>A fun fact, which many people aren’t aware of, is that Joyce was almost a normal writer when he was young. (He was arguably never a normal <i>person</i>, but that’s another story.) <i>Dubliners</i>, a collection of about a dozen short stories, was completed when he was only in his twenties, although only published several years later. Despite its stylistic conventionality in hindsight slash comparison, <i>Dubliners</i> is radical in its subject matter, being concerned with people you don’t meet very often in early 2oth century literature, and preferably with the most sordid aspects of their lives. In <i>A Mother</i>, a young girl tricks a man into marrying her by having an affair with him and then threatening to ruin his reputation. Her mother, in the interest of the financial advantages that the marriage promises, shrewdly overlooks the indecencies committed under her roof. <i>A Little Cloud</i> features an ordinary married man who dreams – preposterously, we understand – of being a poet. When he meets up with an old friend who has become a successful journalist and who shares stories of his romantic exploits in Paris, his own life suddenly seems too dull and philistine to bear. And in <i>Two Gallants</i>, one man scrounges money from a woman he is involved with, while another man plans to scrounge money from him in turn. Every living being is almost constantly nibbled on by another living being. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And then there is <i>The Dead</i>, and the reason why I’m still debating whether to return <i>Dubliners</i> to the Little Free Library where I found it or keep it for myself. <i>The Dead</i> is set in a quite different milieu from the other stories – not extraordinarily wealthy, but comfortable; not intellectual, but educated. The setting is the annual dance of the two Misses Morkans, elderly, unmarried sisters famous for their hospitality. The atmosphere is cheerful with a hint of sadness, or perhaps it is sad because it is cheerful: old friends reunite, it is as delightful as ever, everyone is getting older every year, and everyone is going to die. Gabriel, the nephew of the two Misses Morkans, gives a speech, celebrating not only his aunts’ hospitality – two old women who won’t live much longer –, but also the famous, cherished Irish hospitality itself, which is also dying, drowning in modernity. I reminds you of a late August day when summer is at its most beautiful because it has started to fade away ever so slightly.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Driving back to the hotel with his wife, Gabriel finds her on edge. In their room, she confesses: a song that was sung at the party – an old Irish song – reminded her of a boy she was once in love with and who died, in a sense, for her. And while she cries in the hotel room, and while Gabriel realizes that his role as a husband has been secondary, his performance cheap, there it is again, Joyce’s inescapable sordidness: <i>A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him.</i> <i>The Dead</i> is after all cut from the same cloth as the other stories, and it takes just as pitiless a look at Gabriel as at some of <i>Dubliners</i>’ more squalid characters, or rather, Gabriel takes a pitiless look at himself: <i>He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist…</i> Joyce was never a normal person, and he knew that nobody ever is, that everyone just hides a pit of shame inside themselves.  </p>
