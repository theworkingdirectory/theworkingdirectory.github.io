<p><b>Book miniatures: Smith, <i>On Beauty</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I don’t read a whole lot of contemporary novels. My reading material isn’t exactly evenly spread out over the course of human history, but I’ve never fully understood why anyone would specifically be interested in new books as opposed to anything else that they haven’t read yet from any other point in time. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>On Beauty</i> is very much a contemporary novel. It came out in 2005, which admittedly is a while ago (I was in fifth grade at the time, which blows my mind), but it feels contemporary in the sense that it’s very close to the material and ideological reality of my own life and that of the people around me. It is a novel in which I could appear as an extra. It’s set partly in London and partly in Massachusetts; many of its characters have relocated from the former to the latter; several of them are academics; and the broader issues that are at stake all feel familiar – race, feminism, migration, political polarization, free speech on college campuses, etc.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s a very reasonable hypothesis that this is precisely what draws many people to new books: the fact that they touch on issues that are on people’s minds. To put it differently (or maybe to make a different point altogether), reading contemporary books means being part of a community of readers. Reading Sallust gives you at least the illusion of being alone with the text. When thinking about what to write in this post, I found a <i>New York Times</i> article about <i>On Beauty</i> that said pretty much everything I could have said about it, which is why I won’t. (Of course I could say it better. But luckily, I’m not very competitive.) Most people in my demographic would have the same reaction to the book, and again, that sense of community and shared experience is probably part of the appeal for many. A charitable interpretation of the fact that I don’t find it appealing is that I’d rather be exposed to something that is different, unexpected and not already part of the material and ideological fabric of my everyday life, and <i>On Beauty</i> didn’t do that for me (which, incidentally, is a bit funny, because it counted as a DEI book for me). A less charitable, but perhaps more accurate interpretation is that I’m just always mildly disgusted by the idea that people around me could have the same experience I do, the way I’d feel about other people using my towel or toothbrush.  </p>
