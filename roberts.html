<p><b>Book miniatures: Roberts, <i>Every Living Thing</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Every Living Thing</i> stands in the great tradition of parallel biographies. Its subjects are Carl Linnaeus and Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, two contemporaries who were both committed to the same goal: compiling an exhaustive inventory of all life on Earth. By now, Linnaeus is the much more renowned figure, revered as the father of taxonomy and one of biology’s greatest stars, but at the time, Buffon’s reputation far surpassed that of the obscure Swedish naturalist. As the director of the <i>Jardin du Roi</i> and the author of the best-selling <i>Histoire Naturelle</i>, Buffon was one of the most famous intellectuals of pre-Revolutionary France, on a par with Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu and with excellent connections to the court. Throughout their lives, Linnaeus and Buffon were antipodes, rivals, representing different visions of nature, but also of science itself. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Roberts’s perspective on this antagonism is not that of a neutral observer. <i>Every Living Thing</i> is partly an attempt to restore Buffon’s legacy and, to the extent that it is still necessary today, to undermine Linnaeus’. The latter is now widely recognized not only as the father of taxonomy, but also of scientific racism, whereas Buffon was, as Roberts sees it, only a little bit racist. Linnaeus was a self-important narcissist who published raving reviews of his own work under a pseudonym; Buffon cared little about reputation or fame. Linnaeus believed in the immutability of species; Buffon anticipated evolutionary theory. Linnaeus wrote in clunky Latin; Buffon was famous for his elegant style. Linnaeus believed that life could be squeezed into neat and tidy categories; Buffon saw continuity, detail, richness. Linnaeus was of short stature and chronically ill health; Buffon was – a fact that Roberts mentions more often than I felt was strictly necessary – apparently a really handsome guy. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There’s a couple of very different things going on here. I won’t try to play down the disastrous historical consequences of Linnaeus dividing the human species into biologically distinct races (but we’ll come back to this). I’m also happy to grant that Buffon was apparently the more agreeable (and of course more handsome) human being, but that seems a bit besides the point. Even the fact that Buffon was the superior writer is arguably of secondary importance. What does genuinely bother me about Roberts’ portrayal of the two naturalists concerns the role of classification and categorization. While Linnaeus made it the centerpiece of his work, Buffon believed that categorization was always empirically inadequate and instead described individual life forms in detail without trying to erect an overarching system. Any attempts at imposing abstract labels on life, he (or at least Roberts) believed, always fall short of capturing the unimaginable richness of the natural world. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s a common enough argument. I find it absolutely infuriating, not because it’s wrong, but because it’s so deeply pointless. If you push it far enough, you end up with something like Adorno’s notion of the nonidentical, the idea that any given object or experience in the real world is never fully exhausted by the way in which we could describe it in language, whether in layman’s terms or in scientific terminology. A table is never just a table; there is always something to a particular table that transcends its table-hood. This is all true but, as Adorno well knew, it is also perfectly sterile. To genuinely adopt this view would mean giving up on communication and conceptual thought altogether and retreating into a meditative state beyond the boundaries of language, which maybe we should indeed all do, but then we’re having a very different conversation. Assuming for now that our interest lies in furthering our understanding of the natural world – or of anything else, for that matter –, Adorno believed reason to be indispensable, even knowing that it always fails us. It is a paradoxical conclusion, but I don’t know of a better one. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I don’t think Buffon did either. Despite his emphasis on the individual as opposed to the system, his <i>Histoire Naturelle</i> did have a system, with mammals, fishes, reptiles and cetaceans being covered in different volumes. Even the individual species he describes – man, the cow, the dog – are abstractions, categories formed from very diverse individuals. If Buffon had truly given up on categorization, he would have been unable to write a single word. (On that note, Roberts himself arguably divides the history of biology into two species, the Linneans and the Buffonians.) Abstraction is like wealth. Everyone agrees that there is level at which it becomes excessive, but everyone tends to locate this level just above their own position. Abstraction can go too far, and Linnaeus’s first classifications clearly were straightjackets, but they were fruitful in the long term and were improved on, and they still are and always will be inadequate, and this is how science works. Debating the value of abstraction in abstraction is sterile, and most importantly, it can give rise to the pernicious illusion that there is such a thing as science without abstraction. If there is one type of researcher I loathe, it’s someone who believes their work to be a simple, matter-of-fact description of the world as it is and accuses others of building speculative theories on top of the facts. A fact is just a very simple theory. </p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>A final word on the issue of racism. Roberts’s point is of course that Linnaeus didn’t accidentally bring about scientific racism, but that it was an unavoidable consequence of his impulse to divide and classify everything he saw. Adorno would have said the same; at least under some readings of his work, categorization is always proto-fascist. But it is also not accidental that modern anti-racist movements divide and classify too. I doubt that it’s possible to combat racism without positing a category of black people, or people of color, and this categorization is always inadequate (as opponents of affirmative action programs like to point out), and it is fruitful nonetheless. Abstraction is not just evil; it is the precondition of all action and thought, and debating its value is a moot point.  </p>
