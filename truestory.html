<p><b>Book miniatures: Lucian, <i>A True Story</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I read an excellent annotated edition by Evan Hayes and Stephen Nimis which did wonders for my Greek. I just ordered a similar edition of Thucydides from my library. I’m already so excited.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Lucian’s <i>A True Story</i> is sometimes called the world’s first science fiction text, not an unproblematic epithet but not without justification either, at least as long as ‘science fiction’ means Douglas Adams rather than Ursula K. Le Guin. It is the story of a fantastical voyage, and fantastically silly. In large part, it is a parody of the ethnographic tradition in Greek literature, going back to Herodotus, which recounts the incredible wonders of India, Persia, and other faraway places: ants the size of dogs, trees growing upside down, three-eyed men, red rivers…, all of which the author of course either witnessed first-hand or heard from a very trustworthy source. Lucian, for his part, agrees that all of this is perfectly entertaining, and he enjoys some good clean fun as much as the next chap, but he just doesn’t like authors pretending that any of this is in fact <i>true</i>. Therefore, he would like to make it very clear that everything in <i>A True Story</i> is a complete lie. He has nothing true to tell us, he explains, because nothing interesting ever happens to him, so he’ll just make things up. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And so the voyage begins. It happens for no particular reason and it first leads to the moon. The latter turns out to be inhabited by a whole range of men and animals and hybrids of the two, who turn out to be fighting a war against the citizens of the sun. Epic battle scenes ensue (a staple of this text, equally a parody of literary traditions of the time), with my personal highlight being some tiny creatures attacking each other with asparagus and using mushrooms as shields. Next, our author and his crew (this is a nautical voyage) return to Earth, where they are swallowed by a big whale. They encounter a father and a son who maintain a farm inside the whale (it is indeed a very big whale) and who turn out to be at war with other people also inhabiting the whale. Battle scenes ensue; the weapon of choice are fish bones. After escaping the whale, the crew traverses the ocean, visits various oddball islands such as the island of cheese, and eventually arrives at the island of the blessed where the who’s who of Greek heroes enjoys perpetual banquets as well as a continuous supply of both women and boys in the afterlife. (The only one who pretends not to be interested in the boys is Socrates, but of course nobody believes him.) Eventually, the crew is forced to leave the island, and the journey goes on. There is no point in trying to give a complete and coherent summary; there are a thousand odd details and absolutely no consistent plot to speak of. In short, it is absolutely delightful. </p>
