<p><b>Book miniatures: Loewen, <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> would be a great book if it were about 50% shorter. Loewen is on a mission to denounce everything that he believes American history textbooks get wrong, ranging from the original Thanksgiving to Woodrow Wilson’s legacy, the civil rights movement and the Vietnam war. Wherever he looks, he sees misinformation, distorted narratives, forgotten heroes, forgotten truths. I fully sympathize with this mission, but reading a historian criticizing oher historians (and pseudo-historians) for being factually incorrect for over 300 pages, all in support of a revisionist, anti-racist, anti-colonialist, anti-nationalist perspective on American history that I’m already sold on anyway, is one of those things that I would like to enjoy but don’t. I can imagine that all of this would be a more interesting exercise if you had actually been exposed to the kind of textbooks that Loewen attacks in your own educational trajectory. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What’s interesting about <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> isn’t so much what it has to say about history, but about the teaching of history. The first edition was published in 1995, and it shows. It was another time. Loewen still takes for granted a healthy deliberative democracy grounded in a Habermas-style discourse ethics: if people have the wrong politics, it’s because they don’t know the facts; hence, we need to teach them the facts. If young people these days just knew what really happened during Reconstruction, they wouldn’t be racist. In an era where much of the left has shifted – explicitly or implicitly – towards a more agonistic neo-Marxist populism, Loewen’s belief in communicative rationality seems hopelessly naïve. People’s politics are not determined by the facts they know or don’t know; rather, people believe or don’t believe the facts because of their politics. There is a study, which I think I’ve already cited in a different post, showing that if climate change deniers are exposed to more information about climate change, they deny it even harder. It makes no sense, but it makes perfect sense because humans are not rational agents. None of this changes anything about the fact that Loewen’s intentions here are as laudable as any, and it all probably only goes to show that I’ve turned into a degenerate nihilist who’s given up on politics altogether, which is why <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> is (almost) a great book and this is a substandard blog post even by my modest standards. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>However. The most interesting chapter in this book is about <i>why</i> history is taught the way it is, and Loewen has a surprisingly nuanced answer to it, or rather, quite a number of them, and none of them has anything to do with an evil elite pulling the strings behind the curtain. Loewen talks about the way that publishing houses are organized. How writing textbooks is not factored into the academic tenure process, how textbook adoption committees work, how teachers organize their classes, and how publishers cater to it. Some of this is driven by politics, but some of it is also just a stupid confluence of factors that are in nobody’s interest, and the latter does seem solvable. And so Loewen leaves us with the hope that maybe America, or at least parts of it, can be fixed, one chapter at a time. </p>
