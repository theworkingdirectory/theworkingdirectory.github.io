<p><b>Grief</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Yesterday my grandmother died. She and my grandfather had recently been moved from their assisted living facility to a care home, as their health had become increasingly fragile. They were both over ninety. About two or three weeks ago my grandmother was put on palliative care and was given no medication anymore other than heavy doses of painkillers. I was told that she hadn’t been responsive anymore for several days. Her death came as no surprise. I wasn’t around when it happened; I won’t be around for the funeral.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>She was the first of my grandparents to die. She was the first person to die who I knew at all, not counting a neighbour of my parents who I was vaguely acquainted with and not counting our dog, who died when I was in college. That is to say, I had no experience with grief. I had certain expectations how I would feel when my grandmother died (sad, presumably?). What actually happened was that every time I called her during her last few months – when she was still able to speak – and every time I spoke with my parents on the phone during that period, I teared up. But within a minute of ending the call, all that disappeared and I went about my day as if nothing had happened. I am now writing about her death without any impulse to cry, without a whole lot of emotions at all. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s like I do feel sad about other people’s sadness – her own, my parents’, my grandfather’s – as long as it is sufficiently salient, but I don’t actually have any sadness of my own. My only sadness is by proxy. If I knew that my grandmother was suffering while she died (which I understood she wasn’t) or that she wanted to live on (which she very much didn’t), there would be something to cry about. But her life had just been used up to the very last drop. The mere fact that she’s gone doesn’t cause me any grief. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In the last couple of years, I usually called my grandmother every other week. Those phone calls never lasted longer than five minutes. We didn’t have much to say to each other; she just wanted to hear how I’m doing. I’d ask her how she was doing and she’d always say, well, not great, it’s not the same anymore, but what can you do, there’s no point in complaining, and other people have it worse after all. We might spend another minute talking about the weather. She thanked me for calling and hung up. That was it. The role that my grandmother played in my life didn’t really extend beyond these phone calls. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Nonetheless, and for the record, I am crying now. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>For many years, my grandparents gave each of their seven grandchildren an envelope with some money on Christmas. A few years ago, they stopped. By then, we were all more or less adults, most of us had jobs, some of us had kids. It was the great-grandchildren who now got Christmas presents. All of this was perfectly normal. But every year on Christmas, my grandmother would still slip me an envelope. ‘Because you always call,’ she said. I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone, and I never did. (Until now, of course, but the relevant people aren’t in the audience.) The envelope, as always, would contain a Christmas card and some money. Last year, I kept the card because I thought it would be the last one I would ever receive from there. As it turned out, that was true.</p>
