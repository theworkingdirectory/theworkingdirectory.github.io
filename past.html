<p>There’s a nightmare I’ve had repeatedly in the last few years, in which I get married. (This might not sound all that nightmarish at first, but hear me out.) In the dream, I’m much younger than I am now, perhaps in my early twenties. Something is very wrong about this wedding. I (the dreamer) can’t tell who I (the dreamee) am marrying, but it seems to be someone I don’t know very well. My entire extended family has gathered for the wedding and everyone is pretending that this is a joyous occasion, but everyone knows that it isn’t. Everyone is tense. It might be that I’m pregnant, or something along these lines. The whole affair feels deeply shameful.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>All of this might still not sound too bad, as nightmares go. But the truly scary thing happens afterwards. Usually, waking up from a nightmare comes with a sense of relief – thank goodness, it’s not real. It’s all good. But with this one, I always wake up thinking, wait, did this really happen? Am I sure that it didn’t? My early twenties feel so long ago and everything was so different, including myself. Suddenly I don’t trust that I truly remember what happened back then. Maybe I did get married, but then got divorced, and it was all so shameful that nobody’s talking about it. Maybe I’ve buried it in my subconscious. It always takes me a few minutes to convince myself that this makes no sense. I do remember how I spent my early twenties. I don’t have gaps in my memory that are large enough. I would have a clearer recollection of all of this than the hazy memory of a dream.  </p>

<p>Jean Améry wrote that children live fully in the present, young people in the future, old people in the past. I’m not exactly old. But I’ve recently started to get a sense of what it means to have a past. Past selves are uncanny creatures. They’re a part of you and yet foreign and alien, both inside and outside. They’re temporal parasites. None of this is necessarily about guilt or regret or anything like that. You might have no major issues with your past selves. But they’re still strangers to you; people you don’t know very well, yet who inhabit what you consider to be your self. I dread how crowded it must get in there over time. </p>
