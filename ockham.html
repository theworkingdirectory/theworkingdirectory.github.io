<p><b>Book miniatures: Ockham, <i>Summa Logicae</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Ockham’s monumental <i>Summa Logicae</i> comes in three volumes: one on terms, one on propositions and one on syllogisms. I made it about halfway through the first volume until I decided that this was about as much of a 14th century logic textbook as I could stomach. Ockham discusses categorematic and syncategorematic terms, individuals and universals, subjects and predicates, genus and species, quantity and quality, definition and description, difference, division, opposition, parts, the whole, the one and, every once in a while, God. The <i>Summa Logicae</i> wants to be a sum of everything, and it is nothing if not systematic.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I won’t deny that on some level, it’s as dry as anything I’ve read in a while, but I’d claim that there are two reasons why it is worth a (partial) read after all. The first is the language. The official term of art for 14th century Latin among philologists is bad Latin, and while this may be controversial, it is a language that has changed profoundly and systematically since its alleged Ciceronian apex. As a Latin nerd, I get excited about these things. Second, the fact that logic is such a timeless universal makes it easy to forget that it had to be discovered by actual people over the course of a very long period of time. When I was taking intro to semantics classes, I always wondered what semanticists did all day, other than translating natural language into predicate logic or lambda calculus and back again. Logic never seemed like a field that any real person could make a contribution to. What is so fascinating about Ockham is that he already gets some things right – most famously, that he recognized that universals such as <i>man</i> or <i>table</i> are not entities, but properties, or in modern parlance, functions from entities to truth conditions –, while also being at the same time completely in the dark about others. Even logic doesn’t just exist in some Platonic realm out there; it is a living field of knowledge. </p>
