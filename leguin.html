<p><b>Book miniatures: Le Guin, <i>The Lathe of Heaven</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I couldn’t post anything for three weeks because I didn’t have access to my laptop, so now I’m trying to catch up by outputting four book miniatures at once. Ergo, they’re even sketchier than usual. (I’m not apologizing.)</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>If I’ve ever read any science fiction novels, it must have been as a teenager when I devoured pretty much anything I could lay my hands on, but they haven’t been part of my curriculum in the even remotely recent past. (Unless I classify Butler’s <i>Kindred</i> as science fiction, which probably I should, but a story that is largely set in the past just doesn’t feel much like science fiction.) My hunch was always that science fiction novels are either a) bad or b) formulate some sort of social critique, which I tend to dislike because I’m not a fan of being reminded of living in a society and instead prefer my art to be comfortably escapist. I suspect hybrids between the two categories exist as well, which I imagine are the worst. So I stayed away from science fiction. However, as part of my recent DEI efforts (because I’m trying to be inclusive about who/what to be more inclusive about), I gave it a try.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Le Guin’s <i>The Lathe of Heaven</i> very clearly falls into the not-bad-yes-social-critique category. The story is set in a dystopian then-future-now-past in Portland, Oregon. Its hero is an outwardly inconspicuous loner named George Orr whose dreams have the power to change reality. As in, sometimes he dreams things and then they become true. Orr is understandably concerned about his special gift, which often does more harm than good and over which he has no control. Eventually, he finds himself in the hands of an outwardly benign psychologist, Haber (not accidentally a German name), who manages to leverage Orr’s dreams for his own purposes: using hypnosis and some special technological equipment of his own design, he can induce in Orr the reality-affecting dreams that he, Haber, desires, thereby indirectly affecting reality. Haber does his best to set mankind (as well as, incidentally, himself) on a borderline-eugenics path to ultimate well-being and happiness, but manipulating Orr’s dreams does not always go as expected and of course, things go horribly wrong. Only when (spoiler ahead) Haber dies can a disastrous apocalypse that would have destroyed humanity be averted.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So we all get it. Don’t play God. Orr is a quiet, Taoist hero, Haber is his Promethean counterpart. It’s an old story, and it is admittedly a good one, although I wonder whether there would have been a more interesting way to tell it. In the more salient interpretation of the novel, the reason why man should not play God is because he’s not good at it. He fails; he can’t keep track of all the complex and unforeseeable causal chains, eventually creating only ever greater chaos in his attempt to establish order. But sometimes when Orr tries to dissuade Haber from his world-improvement pursuits, the sense is rather that man should not play God because man isn’t God. God is God. And even if Haber had succeeded in unequivocally improving global health, well-being and happiness, he would still have sinned. In this reading, Orr advocates quietism not because he fears the consequences of action, but because action itself is blasphemous. The world is too sacred to get involved in. And isn’t this what I have been saying all along?</p>
