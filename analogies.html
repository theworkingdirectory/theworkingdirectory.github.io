<p><b>Gratuitous analogies</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>One of my brain’s favourite pastimes is to churn out random analogies that have no deeper import. Here are some that I couldn’t squeeze into any other post.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>1. The anarchist fallacy</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>One day in college, I went to the dining hall with a friend and saw him sneak a drink past the cashier without paying. When I asked him about it, he said he believed food and drinks should be free.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It sounds ridiculous – and, as a matter of fact, it is –, but I was outraged at the time, and I still am when I think back on it. I’m not mad about what he did, of course, but about how he justified it. For one thing, he took a bottle of Club-Mate. (If this doesn’t ring a bell because you didn’t live in Berlin in the 2010s, imagine someone refusing to pay for their soy chai latte.) Free Club-Mate is not a human right. Setting that aside, the more interesting issue at stake here is that food and drink aren’t, in fact, free. I’m happy to grant for the sake of argument that they should, but that doesn’t entail that you can act as if they were. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>A key tenet of anarchism is that to overcome the state, one should act as if the state didn’t exist, rather than take action against it. I don’t know if this is a sensible principle in some areas, but in the case I just described it very much isn’t. Dining halls at German universities are not for profit and, for all I can tell, heavily subsidized to keep prices low for students. If people don’t pay for food and drinks, prices go up for everyone. (NB – I’m fully aware that what my friend did was too small-scale to be of any consequence whatsoever either way. It’s just a matter of principle. It’s the kind of debate college students like to have.) In general, it’s just a strict non-sequitur to assume that in order to change the system, we need only pretend to already live in the system we want. Acting that way can have completely different and detrimental consequences. I propose labelling this phenomenon the anarchist fallacy. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>All of this recently came to my mind again because I noticed that there is an area where I’m also guilty of the anarchist fallacy, and this area is exercise. Working out as if you already had the strength you want to have is not how you get stronger, it’s how you get injured. It’s just not a sensible principle. Where you want to be is one question; how to best get there is quite another.</p>

<p><i>2. When the pain stops</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I came up with a new theory about why people overwork themselves. Some years ago, I read about a study which found that if given the choice between holding their hand in ice water and afterwards in hot water, and only holding it in ice water but for a shorter period of time, people prefer the first option. Or something like that. I don’t remember the details and I’m honestly not sure I ver fully understood them. What I do remember is the conclusion that the authors of the study drew: we love the feeling when the pain stops. We love it even more than being pain-free. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And so my theory is that what draws people to working excessive hours (or exercising, for that matter) is not only the adrenaline rush that comes from work/exercise itself, which is real, but also how it feels to finally stop. The first hour after a tough deadline is delightful. After that, things just get boring, so you need to put yourself through a similar ordeal to get to feel the pain go away again. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>3. Immunity</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Two years ago, my department organized a summer school for linguistics students from all over the world. To encourage socializing and networking, they set up a Discord group for attendees. Although I hardly knew anyone and had no real interest in getting to know anyone, I compulsively checked the group several times a day. (Luckily, after the summer school had ended, it was closed down.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I like to think that what made me so susceptible to this Discord group was that the last time I had any exposure to social media was over ten years ago, when I deleted the Facebook account I had as a teenager. In other words, I have no immunity. It made me think of the Native Americans who died in droves from the flu and other viruses that the European settlers had brought in and which their immune systems weren’t accustomed to. If this analogy is correct, it would mean that we shouldn’t keep kids off social media altogether, but expose them to it in a gradual and controlled fashion to build up their immunity. It is of course also possible that none of this is correct, that I was drawn to the Discord group because these things are just inherently attractive, and that my social-media-free existence had nothing to do with it, in which case this analogy would be even more gratuitous than it already is. Further research is needed. </p>
