<p><b>Book miniatures: Scott, <i>Ivanhoe</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This is one of the longest book miniatures I’ve ever written, so I’d like to emphasize that this is not because it’s the best book I’ve read recently. It’s just that it’s so easy to talk about.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The quintessential historical romance, Sir Walter Scott’s <i>Ivanhoe</i> is a tale of gallant knights and fair maidens, Saxon churls and Norman libertines, crusaders and Saracens, jesters and yeomen, battles and tournaments, valour and high treason, <i>ye</i>’s and <i>thou</i>’s. Castles are conquered, female innocence is defended, witches are put on trial and astonishing feats of archery achieved. It is a deeply regressive pleasure, bafflingly weird and easily the most antisemitic text I’ve ever read. But one thing at the time.</p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The setting is feudal England in the High Middle Ages. The French-speaking Normans have successfully conquered the island and now rule over the local, more rustic Saxons with a heavy hand. King Richard III, the Lionheart, is far away in Palestine fighting the heathens. In his absence, his brother John has taken charge of England. Since John has no intention of giving up his position when Richard returns, the prospect of civil war is looming. Our titular hero Ivanhoe is the son of a Saxon lord – called fittingly Cedric the Saxon – who is a sworn enemy of the Normans and one of the most ardent defenders of Saxon liberty. Cedric’s national pride even leads him to disown his own son, Ivanhoe, partly for following Richard III, a Norman, on a crusade to Palestine and partly for winning the affection of Cedric’s ward, Rowena, a descendant of the highest Saxon royalty. Cedric plans to marry Rowena to his friend and kinsman Athelstane [sic], equally of highest rank, so that the two can breed a legitimate dynasty of Saxon kings capable of casting off the Norman yoke. Having fallen for flaxen-haired Ivanhoe, Rowena rejects the advances of the excessively phlegmatic Athelstane, thus jeopardizing Cedric’s plans to make the Saxons great again. So far the backstory. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The story really takes off at a tournament, where a mysterious knight, who refuses to reveal his identity, defeats one Norman after another before sustaining serious injuries. Much to the astonishment of Cedric and Rowena in the audience, he is eventually revealed to be Ivanhoe, who has just returned from Palestine. Meanwhile, a Norman knight named De Bracy becomes enamoured with Rowena. Knowing that Cedric would never allow him near his ward, he hatches a plan to capture the party travelling back to Cedric’s castle and thereby force Rowena to accept him as her husband. (The details aren’t fully hatched out.) Said party is, coincidentally, accompanied by a wealthy Jewish moneylender (we’ll get to that), Isaac of York, and his daughter Rebecca. Unbeknownst to Cedric and his family, Isaac and Rebecca are carrying the wounded and unconscious Ivanhoe with them in a litter, as Rebecca has equally fallen in love with the valorous knight and (still somewhat inexplicably) has decided to care for him. The entire group is to be taken to the castle of a Norman ally of De Bracy, Front-de-Bœuf [sic], who intends to profit from the whole affair by relieving Isaac of the chief part of his riches. And since the more the merrier, they are further joined by the Templar Bois-Guilbert, who has become infatuated, scandalously, with the beautiful Jewess Rebecca. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The coup is successful, and the Saxons are taken prisoner. While Rowena resists the advances of De Bracy and Rebecca of Bois-Guilbert, Front-de-Bœuf gets ready to torture Isaac, Athelstane is mildly upset about the poor quality of food served at Front-de-Bœuf’s castle, and nobody cares much about Cedric. In the meantime, a makeshift army assembles to free them from their Norman captors. The group is led by two of Cedric’s subjects – a swineherd and a moderately funny jester – as well as an outlaw who is eventually revealed to be Robin Hood and another mysterious knight who is eventually revealed to be Richard III himself. (The revealment, as far as the reader is concerned, casually happens in a footnote [because yes, this is a novel with footnotes]. The sense I get is that Scott thought that Richard’s identity would be obvious to the reader anyway. I wasn’t that smart.) In any case, the motley crew frees the Saxons, kills Front-de-Bœuf and burns down his castle. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>One would be forgiven for mistaking this for the end, but Scott is a good Aristotelian as far as plot structure is concerned, and we’ve only entered the fourth act. I’ll try to cut this short though. Athelstane dies during the storm at the castle and is given a grand funeral, only for it to suddenly be revealed that he is not dead after all. (The author admits in a footnote that readers did not take well to this bizarre turn of events.) Despite the capture of the castle, Rebecca has remained in the hands of Bois-Guilbert, who carries her off to his monastery. When his fellow Templars become aware of the presence of a Jewess in their midst, she is accused of witchcraft and put on trial. For reasons too complicated to explain, the trial is to be decided by a tournament in which Bois-Guilbert must fight any knight who rises up in Rebecca’s defence. Since fighting for the cause of a Jewess is frowned upon to say the least, she seems doomed to die at the stake, when all of a sudden, flaxen-haired Ivanhoe appears to save the day. Still heavily wounded, he fails to even touch Bois-Guilbert with his lance, but the latter happens to die anyway at this very moment, of a broken heart or choked-up evilness. Richard III returns to the throne, Robin Hood returns to the forest, Ivanhoe and Rowena marry, Isaac and Rebecca emigrate to Spain, Cedric is reconciled with Ivanhoe, and everyone witnesses the dawn of a new era of peace and harmony between Normans and Saxons. The end. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is a highly condensed summary. Part of the appeal of the novel is that there is just so much <i>happening</i> all the time. It’s been a long time since I’ve read a novel so relentlessly and mercilessly entertaining. This book is a safe space from critical thinking. Scott’s relationship with historical accuracy is of the casual kind. While the text and footnotes are filled with historical anecdotes and trivia (such as the jester lecturing the swineherd about the Germanic versus Romance origins of words like ‘pig’ and ‘pork’, ‘ox’ and ‘beef’, and ‘calf’ and ‘veau’), Scott’s real goal is to conjure up the spirit of a time and place, and he hardly holds himself accountable to facts. In the preface, he draws a parallel to a recent English translation of the <i>Arabian Tales, in which, retaining on the one hand the splendour of the Eastern costume, and on the other the wildness of Eastern fiction, he [the English translator] mixed these with just so much ordinary feeling and expression, as rendered them interesting and intelligible, while he abridged the long-winded narratives, curtailed the monotonous reflections, and rejected the endless repetitions of the Arabian originals</i>. Sic. It was another time.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And on that note, a note about the Jews. On the surface, the novel depicts the harsh oppression and persecution that Jews faced during the Middle Ages – unlike in the much more enlightened 19th century! – in gruesome detail and sympathises with their plight. However, the narrator also never fails to point out that as a matter of fact, the Jews <i>were</i> unfortunately just very greedy, so who could blame anyone for giving them a hard time? Isaac is a detestable and ridiculous character who even tries to cut a deal when pleading for his daughter’s life. Rebecca is, again on the surface, a model of virtue and charity, but when Ivanhoe, whose life she has just saved, treats her coldly upon discovering that she is Jewish, she humbly accepts his rejection, knowing her place at the bottom of society. And who could blame flaxen-haired Ivanhoe for anything? All of which rather spoils the fun. </p>
