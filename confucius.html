<p><b>Book miniatures: Confucius, <i>Analects</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Here are the four main reasons why I got mad at this book: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>1. Constant comparison between ‘gentlemen’ and ‘small men’ or ‘commoners.’ Some examples:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, A gentleman takes as much trouble to discover what is right as lesser men take to discover what will pay.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, The gentleman calls attention to the good points in others; he does not call attention to their defects. The small man does just the reverse of this.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, Where gentlemen set their hearts upon moral force, the commoners set theirs upon the soil. Where gentlemen think only of punishment, the commoners think only of exceptions.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, The gentleman can influence those who are above him; the small man can only influence those who are below him. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>A gentleman is someone who happens to have been born on top of the feudal hierarchy and is therefore naturally endowed with the potential for virtue and moral rectitude. The gentleman can certainly go astray, which is why he needs precepts such as the ones above. But the small man isn’t even worth talking to. He just cares about his crops anyway.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>2.  Constant talking about the various merits and demerits of various random people. Examples:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, I can talk to Yen Hui a whole day without his ever differing from me. One would think he was stupid. But if I enquire into his private conduct when he is not with me I find that it fully demonstrates what I have taught him. No, Hui is by no means stupid. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, Yen P’ing Chung is a good example of what one’s intercourse with one’s fellowmen should be. However long he has known anyone he always maintains the same scrupulous courtesy. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Of Tzu-ch’an the Master said that in him were to be found four of the virtues that belong to the way of a true gentleman. In his private conduct he was courteous, in serving his master he was punctilious, in providing for the needs of the people he gave them even more than their due; in exacting service from the people, he was just.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Besides being boring as hell, do we really have to constantly judge people? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>3. Pseudo-profundity.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, Learn as if you were following someone whom you could not catch up, as though it were someone you were frightened of losing. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chi K’ang-tzu asked Master K’ung about the art of ruling. Master K’ung said, Ruling is straightening. If you lead along a straight way, who will dare go by a crooked one?</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Master K’ung said, Highest are those who are born wise. Next are those who become wise by learning. After them come those who have to toil painfully in order to acquire learning. Finally, to the lowest class of the common people belong those who toil painfully without ever managing to learn. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, To demand much from oneself and little from others is the way (for a ruler) to banish discontent. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This all sounds deep at first, but I don’t see that there’s really anything meaningful and non-obvious that’s being communicated.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>4. Rules, in abundance. From how to perform different rituals, to how to behave around different kinds of people, to how long to mourn your parents, and even rules like the following:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>He [the gentleman] must not sit on a mat that is not straight.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I never thought I would say this, but can we all just relax and have fun or something? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>


<p>Here’s why I’m probably wrong in my initial judgment: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>1. It was a feudalist society. It was a different time. Plato also had slaves.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>2. The original audience of the text would have known these 
random people, making all of it less random. The point of these sections is that we can learn from the exemplary behavior of others. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>3. I can imagine that some people find some of those quotes insightful. It doesn’t matter that I find most of them not insightful. Here’s one I do find vaguely insightful:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Master said, When everyone dislikes a man, enquiry is necessary; when everyone likes a man, enquiry is necessary.</i></p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>4. A few years ago I read Michael Puett’s <i>The Path</i>, and I should perhaps read it again. It makes a case for rituals and pointless rules, and against trying to assert your own unique and precious personality. The point of ritual is not the ritual; it is to break down the rigid structures that make up the personality you have been inhabiting so far. The point is to make yourself malleable. To do the things you are supposed to do in the way that you are supposed to do them is to stop clinging to doing them in your own way, and clinging to anything that you believe makes up your self is a shortcut to misery.</p>
