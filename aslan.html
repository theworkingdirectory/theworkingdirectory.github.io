<p><b>Book miniatures: Aslan, <i>No god but God</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>After my recent attempt to read the Quran – which, as avid readers of this blog will recall, had ended up being more frustrating than instructive –, I decided that I needed a more accessible route to Islam. Aslan’s <i>No god but God</i> turned out to be just what I needed (and, if I may say so, what many people need these days), i.e., a 250-page introduction to Islamic theology, history and politics, very readable, very digestible, by a practising Muslim who is also, conveniently enough, a Westernized academic who knows his audience. The tenor of Aslan’s book is unapologetically apologetic. His mission is to show not only what Islam is, but also what it can be: a faith based on equality, justice and compassion, fully compatible with democracy and human rights, ready for the 21st century.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It’s just that it still needs to get there. Aslan is not in the business of defending Saudi Wahhabism or Al-Qaeda; he only argues that these movements do not represent Islam as a whole. The case he makes is that what is often perceived as a conflict between the Western world and Islamism is actually a conflict within the Muslim world, between conservative and progressive forces. Another Islam is possible. The obvious counterargument that I suspect many people would raise here is that progressive Muslims are just Westerners in disguise. It’s an argument that could be made both by Muslim fundamentalists and by Westerners who display a diligent awareness of the ongoing effects of Western colonial hegemony. But the West doesn’t hold a copyright on democracy. The first Muslim community created by Mohammed in Medina was remarkably egalitarian for its time and devoted a lot of resources to providing support for its weakest members. The choice between fundamentalist Islam and Western-style secular liberalism, Aslan argues, is a false dichotomy. We need to find a way back to Medina.  </p>
