<p><b>Book miniatures: Rushdie, <i>Midnight's Children</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I enjoyed this book more than anything I’ve read in a long time and would call it a masterpiece if I thought that was a meaningful epithet. However, when I set about writing about it, it seemed that I had little to say. So here is my attempt to find out why I have so little to say. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I mentioned in a <a href="museums.html">previous post</a> that the most popular section of a Western art museum is invariably, if applicable, the Impressionist section. What I didn’t mention is that I actually don’t like this section very much, and not just because of the crowds. It is not that I find the works themselves somehow inferior, trite, unimaginative or anything of that sort. It’s that I’ve seen so many of them, or rather read so much about them. I look at an Impressionist painting and all I see are buzzwords: loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, light changing with the time of the day, everyday city scenes, painted <i>en plain air</i>, disruptive subjectivity, etc. I can’t see anything anymore because I’ve seen everything. The discourse around the works has grown to the point where it overshadows the works themselves. I don’t think this is inevitable, or that it somehow betrays a superior aesthetic judgement. It very genuinely bothers me.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But let’s turn to the novel in question. Salman Rushdie’s <i>Midnight’s Children</i> is the story of a boy, Saleem Sinai, and of a nation, India, and the two stories are one. Saleem is born on the day – more precisely, at the very moment, at the stroke of midnight – when India becomes an independent country, and his life becomes a mirror of the country as a whole. As Saleem, a largely ordinary, perpetually snot-nosed little boy, grows up, he becomes entangled in the major political events of his time: elections and military coups, wars, terrorism, partition. Nolens volens, Saleem is always at the center of it all, sometimes the cause, sometimes the telos of the history unfolding around him. Saleem is India, India is Saleem.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is more than just a hint of magic in this book. Saleem, who is not entirely ordinary after all, eventually discovers that he is able to read the minds of his fellow Indian citizens (a gift which, however, is only temporary, as for some obscure reason it is contingent upon the amount of mucus accumulated in his nasal cavities and sinuses and is therefore lost when the latter are drained during a mildly traumatic ENT procedure). He is not alone in his miraculous powers: The children who were born, like Saleem, at or around midnight on the day India was founded all have special gifts (some useful, some less so), in increasing order of specialness the closer to midnight they were born. Saleem, the most special of all, finds that he can connect telepathically with his fellow midnight’s children and invite them to a sort of parliament in his head, hoping to found a magical task force of the virtuous fighting for good in the young Indian nation, an attempt that fails spectacularly largely because the virtuous are, at the time, about nine years old. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Midnight’s Children</i> contains much more, of everything. It is like India itself – huge and crowded, full of characters, bodies, smells, colours, stories, magic and violence. There is a consequential incident in a washing chest involving a black mango (of sorts), an expert snake charmer known as The Most Charming Man in the World, political imprisonment and assassination, a whole lot of chutneys, manslaughter involving a pair of massive knees, a small hole cut in the middle of a bed sheet, prophecies, curses, incestuous love (of sorts) and a Bollywood film director walking off the roof of a building. There are about a dozen characters who act as Saleem’s parents. Rushdie loves enumeration (a love he shares, obviously, with yours truly), and the novel works partly by sheer quantity. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And yet, at the end of 700 pages, there is a slight sense in which I feel left empty-handed. Because I’ve read it all before, even though I haven’t. Through no fault of its own, <i>Midnight’s Children</i> has become the prototypical postcolonial novel: through its juxtaposition of Eastern and Western traditions, its bold assemblage of multiple genres and narrative styles, its hybrid, fragmentary, anti-essentialist nature; through the way it explores the tension between unity and multitude, the need to construct and assert an identity in the face of Western hegemony without stifling internal dissent, to forge chains of equivalence between different struggles while resisting totality and totalitarianism. It’s all there in Rushdie. I’m not an expert on postcolonial literature (any more than I’m an expert on Impressionist painting), and if I were, I probably wouldn’t feel the way I do. There is a thin layer of ideas and theories, grasped only superficially, that gets in the way of me really seeing the work. Because at the end of the day, Midnight’s Children isn’t about anti-hegemonic discourse and Lacanian <i>points de capiton</i>. It is about a huge snotty nose and a pair of gigantic knees, about flies buzzing around enormous pots of chutney, about Parvati-the-witch, the Widow’s Hand, Cyrus the Great and the Brass Monkey, about the way Bombay smells after the monsoon season, about a silver spittoon, two big moles on Reverend Mother’s face and three drops of blood on the Kashmiri snow. </p>
