<p><b>Book miniatures: Kidder, <i>Rough Sleepers</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is a book that inevitably makes your own life feel inadequate in comparison. Kidder’s <i>Rough Sleepers</i> is an investigation into the lives of Boston’s homeless population. It follows a doctor, Jim O’Connell, who has made it his life’s calling to provide medical care to this particular demographic. Dr. Jim, as he is known, not only treats homeless patients in hospitals but also pays what would otherwise be called home visits, tending to patients under bridges and in alleyways at night. His mission goes far beyond the normal job description of a health care provider. He and his team serve as social workers and psychotherapists, they help people stay off drugs, find housing, navigate the legal system and much more. Not surprisingly, it’s not an easy job and it is not always pretty. Victories are few and small; failures and setbacks abound.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>A few months ago, a man waiting with me at the bus station asked me if I had any change for the bus fare. I found some coins and gave them to him. Later, I wondered why. I don’t usually give money to panhandlers, but in this situation I didn’t hesitate for a moment. The man did not look particularly distressed and I doubt he was homeless. The problem was probably that our public transport doesn’t give change, and nobody wants to pay a $1.50 bus fare with a $5 or $10 bill. (I’ve been there.) That man didn’t really need money, he just needed appropriately sized coins.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Which really raises the question why I was perfectly willing to give money to someone who just found himself in an annoying situation but hesitant to give it to someone genuinely destitute. I don’t think it was just because I had been in said annoying situation myself, although that may have played a part. It’s also not that I suspect homeless people, unlike my bus fare-seeking stranger, of spending the money I give them on drugs – it’s maybe not an unreasonable concern, but not something I really worry about too much. It’s more that the problem of not having change for the bus fare is solvable. I could solve it myself with two quarters and a dime. Homelessness doesn’t feel solvable; it feels like a bottomless pit. Throwing two quarters and a dime in this pit seems to make no difference at all. Reading <i>Rough Sleepers</i>, what made me think of Dr. Jim and his team as real-world superheroes is their unshakable faith that the pit does have a bottom, that their acts of care and kindness, how minuscule they may seem compared to the huge societal mess that is homelessness, do make a difference after all.  </p>
