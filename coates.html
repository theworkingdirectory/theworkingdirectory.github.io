<p><b>Book miniatures: Coates, <i>The Water Dancer</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I don’t usually read books that haven’t been on my reading list for several weeks at least, but spontaneously picked this one up from the recommendation desk at my local library. I kind of apologize for the following post. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates is a non-fiction writer by trade. This explains a great deal. <i>The Water Dancer</i>, his first novel, is in some respects a masterful text and a straightforward failure in others. It is the story of Hiram, a young slave born on a tobacco farm in antebellum Virginia as the son of his White master and a slave woman. Hiram’s special gift is that he wields the magical power of Conduction: by conjuring up powerful memories from the past, he can quickly transport himself and his fellow travelers over long distances. After fleeing from Virginia, he becomes an agent for the Underground Railroad, using Conduction to help other slaves escape to safety in the North. Only at the very end does he succeed in his own personal quest: to reconnect with the memory of his mother, who was sold westwards a long time ago.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is a powerful message in the text. What fuels Conduction are stories and memories: only by remembering their past can Black people find their freedom. There is a whole lot of genuine pain and anger. There are passages such as the following: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>And I saw them fleeing with Irish girls, absconding with mementos of lost children, running with salt pork and crackers, running with biscuits, flying with cuts of beef, inhaling the last of the master’s terrapin soup, taking drags of his Jamaican rum, and then out into the winder, thoughtless and shoeless, but freedom-bound. Black maids running with dreams of holy union, running with double-barred pistol and dirk, so that when confronted by hounds, they pulled out, yelling, ‘Shoot! Shoot!’ They fled with young children dosed into slumber, with old men who shuffled out into the frost, who died exposed in the wood with these words on their lips: ‘Man made us slave, but God willed us free.’ </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is <i>The Water Dancer</i> at its best, fusing bits of reality into a single breathless vision, grim and defiant at once.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But there are also problems, or rather a number of them, all having to do with the fact that Coates struggles with the form, and occasionally the concept, of the novel. One of them is nicely illustrated by the following passage:  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>I now returned to my old room and gathered a few of my effects – my water-jar, my books, my old clothes, and even my old trusty coin was there, undisturbed on the mantel. I stuffed these into my washbasin and walked up the secret backstairs into the study, where I saw my father quietly dozing. I carried my effects up to Maynard’s old room and returned to the study. Then I escorted my father up to his room, my arm under his, helped him out of his clothes and under the covers, and bid him good night. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The next morning, I dressed, tended to my father again, and then drove the chaise into Starfall to retrieve Corrine, Amy, and Hawkins. Corrine and my father lunched and walked the property alone. An hour later, they returned and we served tea. In the evening, after the visiting party had set off, I served my father supper, and then went into the Warrens to see Thena.</i>  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The scene takes place near the end of the story when Hiram has returned to his native tobacco farm, pretending to still be a slave, in order to work undercover for the Underground. It is worth examining the action unfolding in this passage in detail. Hiram moves into the room of his (now deceased) half brother Maynard, as requested by his father slash master in an earlier scene. (His ‘trusty coin’ – long story – will not play a significant role again.) He performs his usual duties. The next morning, he gets dressed (you don’t say). There is the meeting with Corrine, Amy and Hawkins, which you might think would lead to something eventful, but no. The party leaves. More duties, dinner. Virtually nothing happens in these two paragraphs that has any consequences for the story or is of any interest in and of itself.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The question is why these two paragraphs exist. To give some context: something worth narrating happened just before this passage sets in and something happens right after. For some reason, Coates feels the need to give us an account of the 24 hours in between. It’s as if he didn’t understand that time in novels can have gaps, or didn’t feel comfortable executing those jumps. Giving a sequential account of the entire course of events qualifies as storytelling in the same sense that a record from a surveillance camera qualifies as a film. Storytelling is about backgrounding as well as foregrounding, about omitting information just as much as including it. This is a chronic problem in <i>The Water Dancer</i>: if some piece of action takes place in the morning and another in the afternoon, our narrator will dutifully inform us that he had lunch and went for a walk in between. We are constantly forced to witness Hiram getting up, going to bed, dressing, undressing, preparing dinner, washing up, walking somewhere, returning, etc., which is part of what makes the novel so tedious. There is a fun little essay by Eco in which he proposes a method for identifying pornographic films: their defining characteristic, he argues, is long stretches in which absolutely nothing relevant or interesting happens – people riding the bus, having lunch by themselves, and so on, just to space out the more eventful scenes. I cannot think of any other respect in which <i>The Water Dancer</i> qualifies as pornographic, but it sure as hell passes Eco’s criterion.   </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Then there is the issue of dialogue. Coates’ protagonists have the unfortunate habit of explaining the plot to Hiram (and the reader), giving lengthy speeches about their personal (usually tragic) backstories and explicating their emotional whereabouts in excruciating detail. If person P tells Hiram about thing T which is relevant to the story, there will be a scene in which P, in direct speech, tells Hiram about T. This may seem unavoidable but it isn’t, or rather it wouldn’t be if Coates could handle the many varieties of indirect speech, the art of slipping the content of a conversation into a sentence or two rather than letting it play out as a whole, of hinting at what was said or leaving it unsaid altogether and instead depicting the shifting dynamics between characters in more subtle ways. All communication and interaction takes the form of heavy-handed dialogue.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Speaking of characters, or rather the absence thereof. The slaves and post-slaves we meet are, with few exceptions, defined by the same small set of features: they yearn for freedom, love their families and are moderately to severely traumatized. This is arguably a perfectly accurate and appropriate description of the historical experience of a certain demographic, which I genuinely do not mean to make fun of, but it does not make for a personality. Oddly enough, for a novel about Black history, its most interesting characters are White: Hiram’s father who, despite his identity as a slave-owner, comes to develop some fatherly feelings toward Hiram, and Corrine Quinn, an upper-class woman who has dedicated her life to fighting slavery but whose motivation, Hiram feels, is a hatred of the abstract institution of slavery rather than love for the slaves themselves. These figures are granted a psychological and moral complexity that the vast majority of the Black protagonists lack.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This ties in with the final issue I feel the need to complain about: everyone (on the anti-slavery side of things) is very nice. Everyone talks like in a New Yorker essay and articulates very progressive contemporary views. Everyone, for instance, is a feminist. Hiram has a love interest because of course he does, and over the course of the story he comes to the realization, which of course he explains in a lengthy dialogue, that his beloved is not just an object of his desire but an autonomous subject whose independence he must respect. This is very nice, but it is an odd idea in a story set in the 19th century, when feminist discourse had by and large not quite reached those heights. The problem here is not so much historical accuracy which I don’t really regard as a virtue in itself, but that <i>The Water Dancer</i> ends up being a political manifesto rather than a novel. A manifesto which I by all means agree with, and I would happily read it in the form of a New Yorker essay, but it should not pretend to be a novel. It lacks rough edges, it lacks the excess of meaning that distinguishes literature from much of non-fiction writing, it does not allow its characters any room to acquire a life of their own. It is a book that started out as a message before it was a story, and it does not tolerate the latter getting in the way of the former.  </p>
