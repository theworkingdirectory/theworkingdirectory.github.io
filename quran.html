<p><b>Book miniatures: Nasr et al. (ed), <i>The Study Quran</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I cannot emphasize enough how unqualified I am to talk about this book. This is a heavily prefaced  and annotated edition of the Quran, accompanied by over a dozen essays on topics ranging from Quranic Arabic over Islamic law to death and afterlife, together totalling approximately two thousand pages. The only reason why the book is physically manageable at all is because the pages are so thin that while reading it, I lived in constant fear of accidentally tearing a page and thereby deeply upsetting a believing Muslim who might borrow the book later. This is not a Western critical edition; it is by and for devout Muslims, or at least for devout Muslims in spe. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Part of why I’m so unqualified to talk about this book is that I didn’t read it in full. (It’s okay. I’m okay. I forgive myself.) The Quran itself is not long, but for various reasons it’s not particularly suited to being read from cover to cover: there are no paragraph breaks, so especially the longer surahs seem to jump randomly from one topic to the next with no discernible structure; there is a fair amount of redundancy; many verses remain obscure without (and sometimes with) the commentary. Compared to the New Testament, the Quran is less narrative in style; compared to the Tanakh, less OCD about legal matters. Its main speech act seems to be admonition; the main emotion it trades in seems to be fear. Again: I emphatically don’t know what I’m talking about. If Nasr et al. manage to get one point across, it is the absolutely singular status that this text has in every imaginable respect for a huge number of people. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And although reading it and the accompanying essays was on some level instructive and genuinely broadened my understanding of Islam and everything, I also still genuinely don’t understand why this book has the importance it has. I mean no disrespect, but I don’t understand why anyone would believe in the Quran, or the Bible, for that matter. Or rather, I don’t understand what it would mean to believe in them. Questions like whether the Quran is truly God’s word or whether God exists or whether Jesus was indeed resurrected etc. have always seemed to me to be on the same level as questions like whether squares are happier than circles or whether it is colder outside than at night. It’s not that I believe it’s false, it’s that I don’t understand what would make it true.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In Orhan Pamuk’s novel <i>Snow</i>, which I wrote about recently, the poet Ka, who has been living in political exile in Germany, returns to his native Turkey for the first time in years. Having been an atheist all his life, he now suddenly senses the presence of God. But when he tells a long-term devout Muslim about his newfound belief, the man rejects him, saying, and I quote from memory, <i>You can’t believe in God because you’re no longer one of us. First become a Turk. Then you can believe in God.</i> Ka tries to have his own God, but there is no such thing as a private God for the same reason that there is no such thing as a private language. Reading the Quran by myself had no spiritual effect on me, but when I see two women wearing headscarves I feel the vague impulse to wear one myself, for no reason I could clearly articulate. There is no religion outside of community.</p>
