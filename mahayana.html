<p><b>Book miniatures: Williams, <i>Mahāyāna Buddhism</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’m way too tired to produce anything sensible here, but I’ve been meaning to write this for over a week now and it’s starting to stress me out that I still haven’t got around it, so I’ll just pretend that the following counts as a post. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is a medium-sized introduction to one of the major schools of Buddhism, which I read mainly out of interest in the notion of emptiness or dependent arising that is central to the Mahāyāna tradition. (To be clear, Williams also writes about a bunch of other things – Bodhisattvas, Pure Land, Buddha-nature, the various stages of enlightenment, the Lotus Sūtra, the Flower Garland tradition, the bodies of the Buddha, the clash between Chinese Buddhism and Confucianism, etc. As much as I see the point of there not being a point in distinguishing between religion and philosophy, I just don’t care too much about religion.) Mahāyāna Buddhism falls into a number of different schools, whose names (Madhyamaka, Prāsaṅgika, Svātantrika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, Cittamātra...) are used inconsistently (is Yogācāra a branch of Madhyamaka or is it opposed to Madhyamaka?) and generally confusing as hell, so I largely gave up on them. I could see three main points of contention between these schools, which I’ll now just pretend to summarize before abruptly ending this post.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The first point concerns methodology. In arguing against essentialists, is it enough to show that essentialist arguments lead to conclusions that the essentialists themselves would not want to accept, or does one need to expose actual logical flaws in their reasoning? (Are we trying to persuade, or are we trying to find the truth? Aren’t both equally pointless? Very tangentially, it just occurred to me that there might actually be loads of true solipsists in the world who just never bother to explain their views to anyone, because why would they.) Secondly, does anything exist inherently conventionally speaking or is that an oxymoron? (Probably the latter? Do words mean things?) Third, is experience real? (It’s common to contrast experience and reality, and to see the former as a faithful image of the latter at best, but then maybe experience is the only reality. I feel I’m not explaining this well. This was a genuinely interesting section. I need to read more on Yogācāra/Cittamātra.) Anyway. All of this is all obviously kind of subtle and should probably not be taken seriously. As William explains: <i>Those who take emptiness as dṛṣṭi [roughly: doxa] are declared extremely difficult to help.</i> </p>
