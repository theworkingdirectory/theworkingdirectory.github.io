<p><b>Book miniatures: A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (trans.), <i>Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I sometimes wonder why I do these things to myself. It’s not like anyone is forcing me to, other than my hypertrophic superego. This book has just been a pain. It is impossible not to make fun of it, so that’s what I’ll do for most of this post, in the hope that the process will end up being cathartic in some way.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The Bhagavad-Gītā is a passage from the Mahābhārata, an ancient Indian epic about everything. (One or two years ago I read a heavily abridged version that squeezed the entire Mahābhārata into only around 800 pages. In its original form, the text is better measured in feet rather than pages.) The Gītā is essentially a conversation between Arjuna, the warrior hero of the Mahābhārata and the second of the five (titular) Bharata brothers, and Lord Krishna, the supreme Godhead, ruler of everything and Arjuna’s special friend. The story sets off when Arjuna is about to head into battle to fight his one hundred cousins (who, incidentally, all have the same mother and were born at the same time) together with his four brothers  (who, incidentally all have the same wife, all of which really doesn’t matter here but the Mahābhārata is so legendarily weird that it’s hard not to point out things like that), but suddenly finds himself beset by self-doubt. Does he really want to slaughter his own kin, or shouldn’t he rather renounce the world, live in the forest and become a hermit? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>At this point, his special friend Krishna shows up and very decisively declares that killing his one hundred cousins is exactly what Arjuna should put on his agenda for the day. Everyone has a role to play in life: some must renounce the world, some must look after the cows, some must receive offerings from everyone else, some must clean up after everyone else, and some must kill. As Arjuna is of the warrior caste, he falls into the latter category: killing his cousins is not only his right, but his sacred duty, which he can’t shy away from. (In case you’re wondering why the war between the Bharatas and their cousins is happening in the first place: it’s essentially just the incarnation slash reenactment of a larger cosmic battle between gods and demons, which in turn happens because this is just the cyclic nature of things, or something like that, I think?) </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>While Krishna is at it, he takes the opportunity to deliver a lengthy sermon about everything else that Arjuna (and the reader) should know. The most important take-home message is that one must surrender to Krishna. Krishna is, and the following are all direct citations, <i>the Supersoul; the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings; all-devouring death and the generating principle of all that is yet to be; victory, adventure, strength of the strong, splendor of the splendid, and infinite opulence</i>. The only way to attain liberation from the cycle of rebirths is to render devotional service to Krishna by offering him sacrifices and chanting his praise, etc.; everything else is essentially a waste of time, including charitable actions not performed in Krishna consciousness. Note also that Krishna delivers all of this in the first person (<i>Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me</i>), which doesn’t exactly make the message more palatable. There’s a lot of other advice in the book, including on very basic things like food (<i>Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry and burning are dear to those in the mode of passion. Such foods cause misery, distress and disease</i>) and sleep (<i>One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance</i>). Krishna is an opiniated guy.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Besides being a key text for Hinduism at large, the Gītā is also the foundational document of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, a religious organization founded in the 1960s by the translator of this book whose name I can’t be bothered to copy-paste here and whose Wikipedia article contains the word ‘Hitler’ a bit too often. In case you’re wondering, the Krishna consciousness movement is, according to the translator’s preface, <i>genuine, historically authorized, natural and transcendental</i> and <i>gradually becoming the most popular movement in the entire world</i>. So now you know. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The punchline of the book comes in the final chapter: <i>This confidential knowledge may never be explained to those who are not austere, or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me.</i> Turns out I wasn’t even supposed to read this. Krishna’s message is so profound that you’re not even allowed to learn about it unless you already believe it anyway. I’m very tempted to rant about this for another two paragraphs, but the cathartic effect has worn off by now and I’m just back to being frustrated. I think reading books like this one is like lifting weights that are too heavy for me. It doesn’t help, it just makes things worse. I really don’t have to do this to myself. </p>
