<p><b>Against honesty</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Seriously. I mean it.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>There are not a whole lot of moral values that contemporary Westerners can agree on across generations (think about humility, work ethic, diversity…), but honesty would arguably make the cut. Admitting that you don’t care much for honesty qualifies you for a mild case of sociopathy. I have an issue with honesty, at least in a certain, perhaps naive interpretation of the term. My issue concerns the fairly basic idea that there is some sort of moral obligation to tell the truth. To be clear, none of this has anything to do with the age-old question of what to do if a Nazi asks you whether you’re hiding a Jew in your basement (assuming that you are) or if a friend asks you if their outfit looks good on them (assuming the obvious) – this is a different debate which (I suspect) everyone but hardcore Kantians has decided has an obvious answer. I do believe that there are perfectly morally acceptable white lies, but this is not the point here. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Much of the (in my very humble opinion) confusion surrounding the notion of honesty stems from a distorted idea of the kinds of lies people actually tell. One type of lie that advocates of honesty often seem to have in mind is the I-totally-did-not-eat-all-your-cookies lie, i.e., denying some past wrongdoing that caused harm to another sentient being in order to avoid punishment or some other adverse outcome for the liar themselves. While there are arguably a few instances of this type of lie that survive into adulthood (e.g., the I-totally-did-not-cheat-on-you lie), I personally haven’t had much experience with it since I was about twelve. There are also lies such as the I-do-not-make-enough-money-to-pay-child-support lie or the This-is-a-great-investment-opportunity lie, which deliberately conceal or distort some aspect of reality in order to secure an advantage for the liar at the expense of the person being lied to. I’m not defending these lies and I don’t want to downplay the harm they can cause, both emotionally and in practical terms, but if you’re having a discussion about honesty with a friend, partner or family member, this category of lie is probably (slash hopefully) not what is at issue. (There is a minor league version of this category which includes cases like forgetting to get milk from the supermarket and then lying to your partner/housemate/parent that it was all sold out. I refuse to lose sleep over something of this kind.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To make some headway on the empirical question of what lies people actually tell on a regular basis, I decided, in the absence of a more robust data set, to make an inventory of my own lies. As discussed earlier, I set aside altruistically motivated white lies, which pose a different sort of moral dilemma. The lies I’m interested in are lies that are not, from any point of view, <i>good</i>. The question is if they’re bad. I also sidestep any statements that are factually wrong and known to be so by the speaker but that cannot be clearly categorized as descriptive utterances (e.g., ‘I’m fine,’ ‘Nice to see you,’ ‘I wish you all the best,’ etc., all of which are better understood as actions that speakers perform, not as descriptions of the world that could be true or false). Among the remaining lies, I’ve identified the following three main categories. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Type I</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This category includes lies that conceal or distort some aspect of reality, not at the expense of the person being lied to but in order to make the liar look better. My own examples of such lies are far too subtle and sophisticated to be discussed here (and I actually don’t think I’m any more prone to them than the average person, though that’s probably a pretty low bar), but we might think of someone lying about how much TV they watch, how old they are or how good their relationship is with their spouse. There’s a clear sense that this is not, at least if it’s done on a significant scale, particularly healthy behaviour but I don’t see that it causes any direct harm to others (except, perhaps, that it might be somewhat depressing to only be surrounded by perpetually young and happily married people, but then I also suspect that type I lies are only rarely successful in the long term). Ergo, I don’t see this as a moral issue in the strict sense of the word. That doesn’t preclude the possibility of having a meaningful discussion about the value of accepting one’s shortcomings and sharing one’s vulnerability with others etc.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Type II</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is a much larger category. I have a hypertrophic sense of privacy, so when someone I don’t know particularly well asks me how my weekend was, what I like to do in my spare time or anything of this sort, I often end up lying to them, not because I have anything in particular to conceal (which would make it a type I lie) but just because I might find the question kind of personal. I hide large (and largely very boring) parts of my life from various people merely by default. This involves a fair bit of straightforward lying. I do believe that we have the right to grant or deny access to information about ourselves to other people (or institutions) as we see fit, but I’m also aware that this makes me sound like a rugged individualist who can’t put up with the fact that living in a social world isn’t really compatible with being an informationally closed system. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Type III</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The last category is a slightly more complicated case. To give you an idea of what I have in mind here, suppose someone asked you in a regular conversation what colour this day felt like for you. Has it been a purple day so far, or does it rather feel a bit yellowish? Chances are you would have no idea how to answer this question. The problem is not that you don’t want to say, nor that you’re just not sure (yellowish sounds about right, but there’s also a tinge of green? Maybe go for blue?), but that the question doesn’t even make any sense. You have no idea what kind of answer you should give, or how you you are supposed to know the right answer, or even what the question is asking. A surprising proportion of the questions people ask me have this flavour. The only honest answer, if answer is the right word here, is to just stare at them blankly, but since that is not how conversations are supposed to go, you will need to supply some sort of response (Quite yellow today, how about you?) and pretend that it’s genuine, which is a lie. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This kind of lie doesn’t have to be an answer to a question. I often find myself having to keep a conversation going when I have nothing meaningful to say, so I resort to making a statement that seems vaguely appropriate in this context, sometimes without considering whether I would personally endorse such a statement, sometimes knowing that I would not. It doesn’t quite matter. In many conversations I feel more like an AI trying to generate the most acceptable output for a given input than like a human being trying to express an underlying thought in language. Asking an AI to tell the truth is silly; the concept of honesty simply doesn’t apply. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I ended up being unsatisfied with my account of type I and type II lies. The discussion above rests on a classical liberalist distinction between morality as the realm of rights and duties (does it cause others harm?), and the realm of ethics as the realm of living a good life (does it make me happy?, which is my own business). I don’t actually endorse this distinction so I’ll need to come up with something better at some point. </i></p>
