<p><b>Book miniatures: Butler, <i>Kindred</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’ve been vaguely aware of Butler as a big name in science fiction for some time, but had never read her before. I picked up</i> Kindred <i>without knowing much about it, mostly because it’s one of the few of her works that’s not in a series, which I felt I couldn’t quite stomach. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The logic behind the plot of <i>Kindred</i> is nontrivial to explain. It’s the story of a woman called Dana, a black writer living with her husband in 1970s LA, who is suddenly transported across time and space to early 19th century Maryland. As she gradually discovers, the reason for her unusual displacement is that one of her ancestors, the son of a plantation owner, has the power to summon her for help whenever he feels his life is in danger. (Fortunately for the plot, his life is in danger a lot.) As Dana also discovers, she can only return to the future when she feels her own life is in danger (which equally happens quite frequently). <i>Kindred</i> is not strictly speaking a science fiction novel, but it arguably takes a science fiction writer to get you to buy into the overall setting and not abandon the book at this point.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Be that as it may, throughout the novel Dana moves back and forth, repeatedly finding herself stuck as a Black woman in a slaveholder society for what in antebellum time are months and years but in 1970s time turn out to be only hours. She becomes part of Rufus’s (her ancestor’s) household where she works, of course, as a slave. She meets Alice, a slave woman who Rufus habitually rapes and who eventually has the child that Dana descends from. Later, Alice will hang herself. Butler’s portrayal of slavery is, on the whole, intense. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But the heart of the story is the relationship between Dana and Rufus. As Dana’s master, Rufus seems to hold all the power, and only he can protect her from his family, the overseers and a pre-abolitionist society at large. But he also needs Dana to save his life whenever he calls her, and not just step back and watch him die. What is more, Rufus is not an educated man and intimidated by Dana’s ability to read and write. The two are locked in a constant power struggle, both dependent on the other, but there is also affection and friendship. The affection comes, on Dana’s side, with a sense of guilt, especially when the other slaves accuse of her of being too friendly with the master. When Rufus eventually attempts to rape her, Dana kills him, which catapults her back to the 1970s, back home, for good. She loses her arm in the process. <i>Kindred</i> is a story about the power that slaves have, not just in spite of being slaves, but because of being slaves, about the complex dynamics between them and their masters, and about how the past never seems to let us go. </p>

<p><i>Postscript: I’ve noticed that I have a much harder time writing about novels than about non-fiction. I actually really liked this book but I don’t think I’ve said anything interesting about it. Sorry for that.</i> </p>
