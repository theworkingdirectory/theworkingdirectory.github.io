<p><b>Book miniatures: Watts, <i>The Wisdom of Insecurity</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Another recommendation from a friend. (Same friend.) I’m not sure I read this book the way he intended.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>There was a time a couple of years ago when I regularly went to Marxist talks and similar meetings where the local intelligentsia gets together to harangue about the exploitation of the working class and denounce the continuing imperialist expansion of the global North. By and large, I found these events tedious and repetitive. It wasn’t that I didn’t agree, but I never felt I was learning anything new; it was the same story every time. I always wondered why a room full of people, who probably all have busy lives, would agree to listen to a talk whose argument they knew so well that they could literally have given the talk themselves. This seemed a perfect waste of time. It only dawned on me later that you don’t go to a Marxist talk to learn something new about the modes of production or surplus value or alienation or whatever, any more than you go to mass to learn something new about the Trinity or creation or sin. The proper response to a sermon is not <i>I’ve heard this before</i>. It is certainly possible to come across an idea at such events that feels genuinely novel, but the main reason people attend them is to consolidate the beliefs they already hold, to understand them more deeply, and to connect with a community that holds similar beliefs. The proper term for this genre of text, whether written or spoken, is <i>edifying</i>. Sermons are edifying, and so are Marxist talks. I don’t mean this in a pejorative sense. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Wisdom of Insecurity</i> is also edifying. Watts gives us the whole Buddhism 101 story (which I don’t mean in a pejorative sense either) – the world is transient, there is no self, language is just a way of arbitrarily carving up a single undifferentiated reality, we can only find happiness if we give up the struggle, stop clinging and let go, etc. Plenty of people could have given the same talk, but it’s true that Watts gives it better than most, and there is value in repetition. Some ideas take time to truly take hold in your mind and invade your thoughts, for better or for worse. Nonetheless, my response to every second page of <i>The Wisdom of Insecurity</i> was <i>I’ve heard this before</i>. I want to say, again, that I don’t disagree, that I believe all of it, but none of this is really a matter of belief in the sense of attributing truth to a particular proposition. I do believe that the working class is being exploited, but the question is whether it makes me angry, whether it keeps me awake at night, whether it motivates me to take action, and the fact is that it doesn’t. And in the same way, my belief in non-self has arguably hardly made it past my cortex. I have yet to be edified.</p>
