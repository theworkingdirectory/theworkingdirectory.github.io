<p><i>Goal for the summer: write at least one non-book post a week. </i>  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’m about to start the fifth and most likely final year of my PhD, so I've been thinking about post-graduation plans. One of my professors recommended that I apply for a DFG research grant, basically the German equivalent of an NSF grant, for which I’d need to find a mentor at a German university to work with. I hit upon someone in Leipzig who might be a good fit. I haven’t reached out yet, the whole plan is still very much in the early stages and not at all guaranteed to happen, but at the moment it’s as plausible a scenario as any for what I’ll do after graduating. It would be a good option, in many ways. Leipzig is a nice place, the linguistics department is decent, and three years of full funding to work on my own projects without any teaching responsibilities is on some level as perfect as things get for recent graduates.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Still, none of this really makes me excited. There are plenty of good reasons why I’ve wanted to work in academia for what feels like forever, including the fact that my research regularly makes it into the top three most meaningful things in my life, but it’s also true that the idea just always felt vaguely glamorous, and my current postdoc plans do not. Part of the issue has to do with Germany. I’ve noticed that I’m becoming this sort of reverse-chauvinist who perceives everything in their home country as provincial and backward by default. Reading about linguistics in German immediately makes me cringe. The extent to which I perceive English speakers as smarter, more sophisticated and more interesting than German speakers is shocking (and, speaking as a linguist, perfectly systemic). I don’t think this is really a sensible reaction at the end of the day, but the fact remains that moving back to Germany would make me feel that I’ve come all this way only to end up where I started.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But it's not that I’d necessarily be all that much more excited about doing a postdoc elsewhere; the issue is more general. I used to think that doing a PhD was vaguely glamorous (I feel this isn’t quite the right adjective, but I can’t think of anything better), but I’ve been thoroughly disabused of that idea for a while now. The majority of PhD students produce mediocre work (by definition) and then go on to spend the remainder of their lives outside of academia (by necessity). None of this is to disparage anyone’s intelligence or skills or general value as a person or whatever, but it’s hard to be impressed by any field that you see up close. It becomes mundane. It’s hard to be impressed by yourself as well. I never regretted doing a PhD, but it’s not something I’m particularly proud of and I don’t anticipate having much of a sense of achievement afterwards. And by the same token, staying in academia after graduation seemed glamorous from a distance, but once it becomes a real possibility, it seems mundane. It’s just a thing some people do.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Since I’m constitutionally unable to write a single post without at least one gratuitous quotation, I’ll quote Žižek: <i>We have a perfect name for fantasy realized. It’s called nightmare.</i> I wouldn’t go so far, in my case. But it’s true that there is no such thing as a dream come true; there is only reality and it is always mundane. Working in academia is just a job, admittedly one that not many people do, but that goes for most jobs when you think about it. It doesn’t make me special, and unfortunately I can’t think of anything else that does. There’s certainly something that feels healthy and mature and kind of Zen about this sense of disillusionment, about no longer attributing importance to some seemingly significant worldly achievement or success. As I’m growing older, there are fewer and fewer people I actually care to impress. It makes for a lot of peace of mind. But the downside is that it becomes harder and harder to be impressive. To rephrase another famous Marxist, there’s no appeal in belonging to a club that would accept you as a member. The moment you achieve a goal, it stops being a goal, and so you never actually achieve any goals at all, you just use them up the way you consume food and oxygen, and in the end, you have none left. I don’t know if this is a good thing.  </p>
