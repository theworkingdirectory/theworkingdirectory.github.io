<p><b>Book miniatures: Hamilton, <i>Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I was tempted to skip this book miniature because the book is indeed Very Short but then I couldn’t bear the thought of being sloppy in my posting practice. So here’s simply an NSE[Not Short Enough];DR, which successfully obliterates every nuance and complexity that Hamilton has managed to retain in her concise overview, but helps me consolidate my newly acquired knowledge. If there’s one post on this blog that has absolutely no value to anyone other than myself, it’s this one.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 1: Reason and Belief.</i> The strict division between philosophy and religion, a.k.a. reason and belief, that we are accustomed to in the West does not really apply to ancient Indian thought. (And I wish we wouldn’t try to apply it to contemporary Western thought either, but that’s off-topic.) </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 2: The Brahmanical beginnings.</i> In the beginning was the ritual, and the people in charge of ritual were the Brahmins. The  corpus of philosophical slash religious texts that started to emerge around 2000 BCE – a.k.a., the Vedas – occasionally raised questions about the nature of the universe, the meaning of life, etc., but mostly contained detailed instructions on how to properly perform a myriad of rituals. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 3: Renouncing the Household.</i> In the 5th century BCE, the Buddha recommends that people stop obsessing so much about rituals, give up the bourgeois lifestyle of a householder in order to become a monk (though not an excessive ascetic) and let go of desire and attachment in order to break the soul-crushing cycle of suffering and rebirth. The Buddha also proposes the doctrine of non-self and dependent origination but is never very clear about what exactly he means by it, which leads to confusion down the road (see chapter 6). By and large, direct experience and personal soteriological quests are more important to Buddhism than the written canon and abstract philosophical speculation. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 4: Issues and Justifications.</i> In response to the threat from Buddhism, followers of the orthodox tradition begin to formalize arguments in defence of the rituals and the Vedas (and, incidentally, the caste system. The Brahmin's privileged position can only be justified if the rituals that they are in charge of are indeed essential to society). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 5: Categories and Method.</i> Of the six orthodox philosophical schools in ancient Indian thought, known as <i>darśanas</i>, the first two, Vaiśeṣika and Nyāya, develop around the third century BCE. Epistemologically, their practicioners seek to define the rules of logical reasoning; ontologically, they are pluralistic realists concerned with categorizing the various components of reality (substances, qualities, etc.). It all feels very Aristotelian. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 6: Things and No-things.</i> In the Buddhist tradition, people try to make sense of what the Buddha meant by non-self. Some schools develop a Vaiśeṣika/Nyāya-style hardcore realist ontology, apparently thinking that he didn’t mean anything by it at all. In contrast, the Madhyamaka tradition goes all in on emptiness, proclaiming that nothing exists independently. Everything that can be said to exist conventionally depends in its conventional existence on something else.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 7: The Witness and the Watched.</i> We encounter <i>darśanas</i> no. 3 and 4: Yoga and Sāṃkhya. Yoga is basically like yoga, but for the mind. Sāṃkhya proposes a dualistic ontology according to which everything is either <i>puruṣa</i>, observing consciousness, or <i>prakriti</i>, unconscious reality. I didn’t quite get the idea but it seemed interesting enough (and somewhat reminiscent of systems theory?), so I put it on my reading list.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Chapter 8: The Word and the Book.</i> We’ve arrived in the 5th century CE. The grammarian Bhartṛhari says some very interesting things about the relation between language and world that I won’t try to summarize here but put on my reading list, so stay tuned. Bhartṛhari influences the last two  <i>darśanas</i>, Mīmāṁsā and Vedānta. Mīmāṁsā practioners largely obsess about ritual (again). The Vedānta school is founded by Śaṅkara and remains the most prominent system of Indian philosophy in the West. Śaṅkara seems to have been a semi-Madhyamaka-semi-Vaiśeṣika-ist who argued that the apparent plurality of things  exists only conventionally, whereas what exists independently is only one. Vedānta as a whole seems very diverse and complicated. I put it on my reading list. The end. </p>
