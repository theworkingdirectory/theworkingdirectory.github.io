<p><b>Book miniatures: Bolaño, <i>Nocturno de Chile</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I feel the need to apologize (to myself? To who else?) for another post that barely scratches the surface of the text. It’s Sunday night, I have a full week ahead of me and I’ve already finished another book I need to write about.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Literature tends to portray evil in one of two ways. On the one hand, there are the Disney villains: caricatures of pure immorality, laughing demonically as they plot to destroy their innocent victims for fun and pleasure. And then there are the villains who had a hard childhood, who were perpetually misunderstood, who struggle to articulate their feelings and who really just need a big hug. <i>Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner</i>: to create Disney villains is to not understand the nature of evil, but to create villains who had a difficult childhood is to forgive them.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Bolaño manages to create a character who we understand but cannot forgive, in part because he cannot forgive himself. <i>Nocturno de Chile</i> is a novella without paragraph breaks, narrated in a single breath, and it is the protagonist’s last. Sebastián Urrutia Lacroix is a cleric, literary critic, (unsuccessful) poet and general purpose intellectual who becomes involved – in complicated, if not absurd, ways – in the Pinochet dictatorship. His life, as he recounts it on his deathbed, is devoted to the arts, but politics sneaks up on him, until he finds himself at a literary soirée knowing that in the basement of the house, opponents of the regime are being tortured. There is no single, isolable crime, only a life lived wrongly, and there is no moment of reckoning, no admission of guilt, only an uncomfortable feeling lingering in the background that the world is morally out of joint. As Montaigne said, <i>Vice engenders in the soul, like an ulcer in the flesh, a remorse which is always scratching itself and drawing blood. For reason obliterates other grief or sorrow, but it engenders those of remorse, which is harder to bear because it springs from within, as the cold and heat of fever are sharper than those in the outer air</i>. To understand a character is to see yourself in them, which makes not being able to forgive them such a terribly uncomfortable feeling.</p>
