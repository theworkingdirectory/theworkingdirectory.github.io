<p><b>Book miniatures: Ts'ao, <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I’ve noticed that I’ve developed the habit of prefacing every other post with an apology for the poor quality of this blog, which is becoming tedious. Therefore, I would like to apologize once and for all for everything I have ever produced and will ever produce in the context of this blog, as well as for my excessive apologizing, and be done with it.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>More to the point: I read the translation by Chi-Chen Wang.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Anyone who has ever read, or tried to read, a Tolstoy novel will complain about reaching page three of a book the size of a brick and already having encountered about two dozen characters, each of which has about three different names and is related to a dozen other characters in ways that feel impossible to keep track of. <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i>, one of the classic Chinese novels of the 18th century, is worse. There are around forty main characters (according to Wikipedia), most of which are part of a single, massive dynasty and all of which of course have Chinese names (good luck keeping apart Chia Gen, Chia Ging, Chia Cheng and Chia Jung). My translation includes a genealogical tree, but since it is incomplete, I ended up relying on the wisdom of the internet at large to keep track of at least the bare minimum of who’s who. Which is not made easier by the fact that different English translations transliterate the Chinese names differently (it turns out that Chia Cheng and Chia Geng are in fact the same person) and also differ in whether and how to translate the names. Wang renders only the women’s names in English (at least most of the time), in addition to two male characters called Adorable Perfume and Lovely Jade (for precisely the reasons you would expect), but apparently there are versions that translate the servants’ names into English, the names of Daoists and Buddhists into Latin, those of actors into French, and keep everything else in pinyin. And on top of all of this, the characters hardly ever address each other by name anyway but with a complex system of honorifics that includes among others, and this is true, a special term for the wife of an uncle who is younger than one’s father. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>All of this aside, <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i> is an irrestistible text, light, graceful, and moving at a quick pace. It is, at its heart, the story of a love that was not meant to be, between two distantly related members of the Chia clan, Pao-yu and Black Jade. Why it is not meant to be is never perfectly obvious – it is true that Pao-yu’s grandmother wants him to marry another distant relative, Precious Virtue, rather than Black Jade, but the matriarch’s preference doesn’t seem particularly insurmountable given that Pao-yu is her favourite. It is also true that Black Jade is of poor health and will eventually die of tuberculosis, but of course what she truly dies of is a broken heart, which could have been prevented if Pao-yu had not married someone else. It is more like the impossibility of their love is the precondition of it. Both Pao-yu and Black Jade are capital R Romantic types – artistic, sensitive, proud, consumptive – and the idea of them getting married, having kids, paying bills and enjoying an occasional nice dinner together doesn’t really fit with that. After Black Jade’s death, Pao-yu eventually renounces the world and becomes a wandering hermit, while the rest of the once-powerful Chia dynasty declines into obscurity. In <i>Dream of the Red Chamber</i>, pleasure, beauty and fame are only vain promises that can never last, and yet the text creates a space for them – not as something to ever be achieved, but as something to be experienced in the moment of it slipping away. </p>
