<p><b>Book miniatures: Dostoevsky, <i>White Nights</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This is a collection of some of Dostoevsky’s short stories and novellas. I skipped</i> The Gambler <i>and</i> Notes From the Underground<i>, which I read recently, and</i> The Double<i>, which I read a while ago and might re-read soonish. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>I obsessed about this book miniature for far too long because I read Dostoevsky so much and I love him so much that I felt the need to squeeze everything I have ever wanted to say about him into this post. As will be obvious, I didn’t. It’s okay. I’m okay. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Last year, I attended a book club at our local library for a few months. It was called the Great Books Book Club (I know), and focused on classics of the digestible kind (which I don’t mean in a pejorative way). One month, we read <i>Crime and Punishment</i>. I remember the group being rather lukewarm about it, and one woman in particular (the leader of the group, in fact) kept asking, What’s the big deal? Why is the end of Christianity the end of the world? Does it really matter all that much if people believe in God? Why all the despair? (I quit the book club after that meeting.)  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It is a big deal. (And I apologize in advance for talking about religion again in this post. I’m not converting, I promise.) Because unlike the author of this post, Dostoevsky doesn’t think about religion as some sort of vaguely interesting intellectual puzzle. All of his major protagonists, whether they realize it or not, yearn for redemption. Redemption isn’t a reward promised after death for being a good boy during your lifetime. It’s not that being good is just the smart and rational choice to make. The fact is rather that at any given moment, earthly existence is unbearable, or it would be if it weren’t for the idea that you might be redeemed, and not only after your death, but right now. And the only way in which you can be redeemed is through love, but to love is the hardest thing of all. Dostoevsky’s characters are, by and large, detestable characters, petty, sulky, spiteful, sometimes drawn to evil for its own sake. Lewis wrote that those best equipped to join Christianity are those who seem completely lost, who hate themselves, who are hated by everyone. Dostoevsky, who according to the editor’s preface <i>bitterly resented contemporaries who were richer, better-looking and more elegantly dressed than himself, that is, almost everyone he knew</i>, fit the bill perfectly.  </p>
