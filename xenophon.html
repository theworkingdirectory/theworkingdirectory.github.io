<p><b>Book miniatures: Xenophon, <i>Apology</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Like Plato’s dialogue of the same name, Xenophon’s <i>Apology</i> is an account of Socrates’ trial, which famously ended in his being sentenced to death. Like Plato, Xenophon is mainly interested in Socrates’ own response to the accusations, but unlike Plato, he manages to make him seem like an absolute jerk. [I ran this sentence by DeepL Write, which suggested I replace ‘jerk’ by ‘fool.’ Not what I meant though. As an experiment, I replaced ‘Plato’ by ‘John,’ ‘Xenophon’ by ‘Bill’ and ‘Socrates’ by ‘Göring.’ DeeplL now suggests ‘a complete idiot.’ AI is fun.] Faced with the claim that he has gained undue influence among the young people of Athens, Socrates explains that yes, he has taken an interest in their education, and since he is the foremost authority on education, why aren’t people grateful? And to accuse him of impiety is, of course, nonsense – not only does he honour the gods, but they actually speak to him personally and have imparted much wisdom to him. Socrates also takes the opportunity to point out that Apollo himself, according to the oracle at Delphi, judges him to be far superior to the rest of humanity, and that he (Socrates) has never been guilty of any sort of wrongdoing whatsoever but is simply the wisest, most just and most free man who has ever lived. As Schopenhauer said, modesty in great men would only be dishonesty. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Although he thus considers his trial to be completely baseless (and the men in charge of it [according to DeepL] to be absolute idiots), Socrates nevertheless declares himself ready to die, since a) staying alive would mean facing old age, dependence on others for care, prolonged physical suffering, etc., so he’s not really missing out on anything, and b) being wrongly condemned to death is great because it will maximize the grief that his friends feel at his death, the allure of which didn’t become very clear to me but apparently it’s the best way to die. (All of this sounds like the grapes of survival were too sour for Socrates.) His friends indeed experience maximized grief, for reasons that didn’t become very clear to me either. At this point, I’m trying very hard to come up with something positive and/or interesting to say about this text so that I can fill two reasonably sized paragraphs, which I normally consider the minimum length for a book miniature. Xenophon’s Greek is somewhat easier than Plato’s. His <i>Apology</i> is shorter than Plato’s. I wonder if my inability to appreciate Xenophon makes me an absolute idiot. I wonder why I usually try to actually write something sensible in these posts. I wonder if I would have disliked Socrates as much as I do if I had met him in real life. Maybe he was actually a perfectly nice human being, but then his students felt the need to justify the fact that they had spent hours on end with a very weird old guy who kept on asking questions that had no clear answers and (I speculate) complimenting them (said students) on their abs, resulting in him being posthumously turned into this excessively sagely figure who bores everyone to death. </p>
