<p><b>Book miniatures: Montaigne, <i>Essays</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This may well be one of my top 10 favourite books of all time. Since I won’t be able to do it full justice, and since Montaigne himself constantly emphasizes that he doesn’t do any of his subjects full justice, I’m going to treat the book here in a Montaigne-like fashion, that is, in a series of mini-essays that ramble on about too many things at once without any attempt to be particularly clear or to the point. (I’m embarrassed to admit that I read the English translation by J. M. Cohen, as the 16th-century French proved too much for me. I’m also embarrassed that I am in fact embarrassed about such a thing.) </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>On eggs </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There's a passage in one of Montaigne’s essays in which he discusses the notion of similarity and points out that strictly speaking, no two things are ever exactly alike. Similarity is an illusion that disappears if you look closely enough. The one possible exception: eggs, which can indeed look perfectly alike. But, Montaigne contends, there have been reports of people being able to reliably tell one egg from another, so his argument still stands.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It had never occurred to me that the existence of two or more things that are perfectly indistinguishable to the naked eye is a novelty in human history. We are constantly surrounded by objects that are, as far as we can tell, completely identical – two spoons, two shirts, two smartphones –, but in Montaigne’s early modern world, this was an anomaly, a peculiar property of eggs. (Benjamin of course recognized mechanical reproduction as a distinctive feature of the modern age, but what he found significant was specifically the possibility of having an exact replica of a work of art, not, more radically, an exact replica of anything.) </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Montaigne writes: <i>If our faces were not similar, we could not distinguish a man from a beast; if they were not dissimilar, we could not distinguish one man from another. All things hold together by some similarity; every example limps; and the comparison which is derived from experience is always weak and imperfect; yet comparisons always join at one corner or another.</i> (On that note, there are clear similarities between this view and something like medieval nominalism or Adorno’s notion of the non-identical.) And later: <i>Reason has so many shapes that we do not know which to take hold of; experience has no fewer. The conclusions that we seek to draw from the likeness of events are unreliable, because events are always unlike. There is no quality so universal in the appearance of things as their diversity and variety.</i> Generalizations of any kind are only poor approximations, lacking predictive power. The world is just a shapeless multitude without order or meaning.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I wonder if it matters that we’re now so used to having multiple versions of the same object. If it somehow changes how we see the world. Perhaps we’ll all become universalists again, believing that the Platonic idea of the iPhone 12 has emanated into multiple, ontologically lesser material copies. Then the world wouldn’t just be a random pile of stuff that can never be subsumed under anything: it would be ordered, containing identical instances of the same abstract ideas. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>On curiosity </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>One of the privileges of the essayist is to be able to contradict themselves without incurring penalties. Montaigne writes: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>No man ever knows how to stop at the limits of his needs; of pleasures, riches and powers he grasps more than he can hold; his greed is incapable of moderation. I find that it is the same with his curiosity to know; he cuts out much more work for himself than he can do, and very much more than he has any need to, in the belief that the utility of knowledge is proportional to the amount of its subject-matter. ‘In learning, as in all things, we are addicted to intemperance.’ [Seneca]</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And later, in a different essay: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>It is nothing but a personal weakness that makes us content with what others, or we ourselves, have discovered in the hunt for knowledge; a man of great ability will not be satisfied with it. There is always room for someone to improve on us; indeed, for us to improve on ourselves, and there is always a different road to follow. There is no end to our investigations; our end is in the other world. It is a sign of failing powers or of weakness when the mind is content. No generous spirit stays within itself; it constantly aspires and raises above its own strength. It leaps beyond its attainment. If it does not advance and push forward, if it does not strengthen itself, and struggle with itself, it is only half alive. Its pursuits have no bounds or rules; its food is wonder, search and ambiguity. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The first passage talks about curiosity as a sin, as hubris, as an excessive craving that must be kept in check. We must learn to be content with the little knowledge we can handle. Our heads aren’t big enough to hold the whole world. In the second passage, the desire to know more and more is a mark of greatness:  it is man’s <i>raison d’être</i> to strive and to keep striving, to always want more, to never be content. If one were partial to great master narratives, it would be tempting to see an underlying historical shift at work here, from the medieval suspicion of <i>curiositas</i> – going back to the forbidden tree of knowledge and Thomist theology – to the more positive notion that emerged in the context of humanism and that asserts man’s right and power to know the world. (I suspect there are loads of historians out there who would consider this an oversimplification at best, and I don’t really know what I’m talking about after all, so I’m hiding behind the irrealis). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There are three kinds of questions in the world. The worst questions are those that have no answer because they are vague, ill-defined or based on false assumptions. The better questions are those that have an answer that is out there for us to find. The best questions have no single answer because they have two, and there is no way to decide between them. It is not that both answers are true in some sense, with some limitations, to some extent, but both are perfectly true at the very same time, and yet they contradict each other. In an old-fashioned division of labour, it would be the task of science to answer questions of the second kind and the task of philosophy to resist answering questions of the third kind. The question of curiosity would fall into the latter category. The world <i>is</i> too big for our heads. We do want to know too much, more than we can handle and more than is good for us, and we will inevitably fail. But then trying and failing is the whole point of it all. Contentment is for losers. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>On good looks </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>There is nothing more probable than that the body conforms and is related to the soul.</i> A recurring theme in the <i>Essays</i> is physiognomy, the notion that a person’s outward appearance betrays their inner character: A virtuous mind will inhabit a beautiful body, while a deformed, disfigured, misshapen body must contain a depraved mind. Montaigne himself is not completely sold on the idea – <i>A face is a poor guarantee; nevertheless, it deserves some consideration</i> – but he has no doubts about the benefits of good looks in a society that is, on the whole, very much sold on physiognomy: <i>I cannot say often enough how much I value beauty as a quality that gives power and advantage.</i> The point here is not merely that some people are judged to be attractive and others ugly, but rather that some people, on the basis of their appearance, are judged to be smart, kind, tough, witty and the like, and others as the opposite of all of these, and that both groups are treated accordingly. The body conforms to the soul; it is an open book to those who know how to read it. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Pick up any 19th century novel – Balzac, Dickens, Dostoyevsky – and you find the idea of physiognomy not explicitly spelled out but implicitly at work: a protagonist's full lips indicate a vulgar and indecent character, a high forehead an intelligent and thoughtful person, white teeth a healthy and happy condition. This doesn’t mean that there is a fixed inventory of facial or bodily features that neatly map onto a particular set of character traits. Part of the novelist’s task in this tradition is to give us a sense of a character’s personality by describing their physical appearance, and while this does require drawing on preexisting associations, it is – ideally, at least – more nuanced than simply looking up ‘stingy’ in a physiognomy dictionary and finding ‘thin lips, dry skin.’ It is a technique that requires skill and practice. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Nowadays, believing in physiognomy is called discrimination, most notably when it comes to race, disability and weight. A contemporary novelist would no longer foreshadow a character’s upright and honest behavior by giving them blond hair and blue eyes. Even features that are less obviously tainted – say, height – feel inappropriate to use as signifiers of personality. We’ve all learned by now that we shouldn’t judge people by their looks. Some people happen to be short, but that doesn’t <i>mean</i> anything. It shouldn’t affect how we think about them or how we treat them. Montaigne’s uncritical acceptance of the sway that physical attractiveness hold in society – <i>We have nothing that gives a man better credit</i> – is genuinely irritating.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The question is how this affects the novel. Don’t the characters still have to look one way or another? Is it odd not to know the hair colour of the main protagonist? And if we do know it, how can it not be significant? Readers draw inferences from every piece of information that they can get their hands on, so if a character has, say, a pale complexion, large hands or a pointed nose, we will interpret this as a deeper statement about their life, their personality, the future that awaits them, and so on, whether it is politically correct or not. How do you deal with this as a novelist? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And then there is the fact that physiognomy, while perfect nonsense for children and young adults, becomes weirdly true the older you get. Old people do look like the person they are. After a certain point, your face starts to permanently wear the expressions you keep on putting on every day. Your favourite smile, or maybe none at all. A recurring frown. Beyond the face: your posture – upright or hunched –, the way you swing your arms when you walk, little patterns in your movements. When you are old, your body has long been shaped by your mind; you are an open book.  </p>
 
<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>On death</i>  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The <i>New Yorker</i> podcast <i>Critics at Large</i> recently had a fun episode about TV series finales, in which the three hosts discussed famous and infamous finales, what makes for a great finale, and whether and why they actually matter. One host made the case that finales are overrated and are at the end of the day just another episode among many. Another host disagreed, arguing that what makes finales special is that they can retrospectively change your view of the whole series, for better or for worse, suddenly making you see everything you’ve seen before in a new light. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is how the young Montaigne thought about death. <i>In judging another man’s life, I always inquire how he behaved at the last; and one of the principal aims of my life is to conduct myself well when it ends – peacefully, I mean, and with a calm mind.</i> Death is the touchstone of life: even if you have led a perfect life, you can still ruin everything the moment you die, the way a great series is ruined by a bad finale. It is important to leave this world with dignity. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Towards the end of his life, he seems to have thought otherwise. <i>If you do not know how to die, never mind. Nature will give you full and adequate instruction on the spot.</i> Perhaps dying is easy. You just leave. </p>
