<p><b>Book miniatures: Sallust, <i>Bellum Iugurthinum</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Long time no post. I have a list of overdue book miniatures to get done, starting with Sallust vol. II – the Jugurthine War. Apparently, I was in an unusually paratactic mood today.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged by Marxists that imperialism arises as a structural consequence of capitalism. Sallust’s <i>Bellum Iugurthinum</i> serves as a healthy antidote to this view. Set in the robustly pre-capitalist second century BCE, the eponymous war between the Roman Republic and the North African kingdom of Numidia has the all-too-familiar plotline of an imperialist superpower intervening in a conflict in the global south in the name of restoring peace and order and ending up causing damage to the local community for decades to come. Contemporary analogies are too obvious to be named.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Numidia, at the beginning of the story, is an independent kingdom in present-day Algeria and an ally of Rome since the days of the Second Punic War. In 118 BCE, conflict breaks out over the succession to the throne: the old king Micipsa has decreed that land and kingship be divided between his two sons Adherbal and Hiempsal and his nephew Jugurtha, but upon his death, it becomes clear that Jugurtha – a highly intelligent, power-hungry monomaniac very much like Sallust’s other famous supervillain, <a href="catiline.html">Catiline</a> – is not keen on sharing. Soon, Hiempsal is dead, and Adherbal fears for his life. In his desperation, Adherbal sends to Rome for help.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Whether Rome should or should not get involved in what is technically a civil war outside its own borders is one of the more interesting questions raised by the text. Rome and Numidia are not partners on an equal footing. Although technically autonomous, Numidia is little more than a satellite state, dependent on Rome for its political survival. The case Adherbal makes in his plea to the Senate is that the usurpation of a dynasty that is under Rome’s protection is a direct attack on Rome itself; this is not just a Numidia-internal conflict but Rome’s own business. With Rome’s great power comes great responsibility. We have no other friends because we are friends with you, Adherbal argues, so it is your duty to step in. This is your backyard. The Jugurthine War is a case study in international relations and martial law, about who has the right – or the responsibility – to initiate military action in the age of proto-imperialism.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Rome is reluctant to intervene. Not only is Jugurtha well-known and well-liked in the capital – he served in the Roman army as a young man and distinguished himself as a skilled military leader –, but he has also judiciously bribed half the Senate to keep Roman troops out of Numidia. Adherbal, on the other hand, is a weak, timid and apparently not particularly bright character. The Senate, therefore, does little more than send a diplomatic mission to Numidia, kindly reminding Jugurtha to share power with his cousin, as the late king had intended. Jugurtha kindly agrees; the fighting for the throne continues. Soon after, Adherbal finds himself besieged in the city of Cirta, and the outlook is bleak. He eventually surrenders, having been persuaded by his men that Rome’s power is too great for Jugurtha to dare do him any harm. Jugurtha has Adherbal tortured and killed without hesitation. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Meanwhile in Rome: with popular pressure mounting, the Senate finally declares war on Jugurtha. What follows is a protracted war that neither side seems likely to win any time soon. Against the more powerful Roman armies, Jugurtha wisely avoids open battle and fights a guerrilla war. The Romans suffer defeat after defeat; the land is as hostile as the people, long stretches of desert with no water supply and infested with snakes; the best they can do is attack the civilian population. Battles are won and lost; peace treaties are forged and broken. Jugurtha is constantly on the move, striking here and there, trusting few allies, clearly losing his mind. The background to the scene is formed by Roman power politics, with senators, consuls and tribunes all trying to play the war to their own advantage.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Ultimately, Rome wins the war by bribing slash blackmailing one of Numidia’s few remaining trusted allies, a local king named Bocchus, who lures Jugurtha into a trap and hands him over to the Romans. It is not a glorious victory. Sallust dwells on those final days, when Bocchus has already formally agreed to the betrayal but remains torn, debating with himself whether to remain loyal to Jugurtha or surrender to Rome. For a moment, everything is still up in the air: everything still hinges on a minor character who must decide whether or not to continue to resist the increasingly irresistible power of Rome. One can’t help wondering where Sallust’s own sympathies lie, since he always bemoaned the loss of good old-fashioned virtues like courage, fortitude and loyalty in his time. Jugurtha himself, meanwhile, simply fades from view. Unlike Catiline, he is not given a heroic final scene on the battlefield. His capture is shown in a long shot; his ultimate fate remains open.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The <i>Bellum Iugurthinum</i>, needless to say, is not an impartial document. It is true that Sallust is as ardent a critic as anyone of the corruption, nepotism, ruthless power politics, inept leadership and general moral decline that he witnessed in the late Republic, and he is not in the business of asserting Rome’s right to rule the world. Nonetheless, his perspective is a strictly Roman one, and he seems to have had little interest in how the Jugurthine War affected the Numidians themselves: How it felt to live for years under constant violence, with food shortages and famines caused by the Romans deliberately destroying crops and livestock to starve Jugurtha’s armies, in a country torn in two by civil war, with some communities on Jugurtha’s side, others on Rome’s, and you could never know which was which. If the subaltern cannot speak, Sallust certainly does not speak for them. </p>
