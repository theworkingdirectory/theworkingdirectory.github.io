<p><b>On blogging</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I started this blog about a month ago, so this seems like a good time to very briefly explain the purpose of the whole enterprise. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The motivation for this blog is twofold. For one, it is a very straightforward writing exercise. It’s been a very effective one, in the sense that I’ve become painfully aware of the shortcomings of my writing. I struggle with endings. I overuse adverbials. In general, the temptation to add yet another modifier (or, for that matter, parenthesis) is often too strong to resist. I’ve read too much David Foster Wallace. My style tends to be stilted, sententious and pretentious; it often doesn’t flow naturally. I wonder if I’m really as funny as I like to think I am. As a non-native speaker of English, I sometimes run a text through DeepL Write before publishing it, which is how I have also learned that I habitually use ‘which’ as a relative pronoun where ‘that’ would be correct, often put my already excessive adverbials in the wrong places and should be more careful with gerunds. Reading your own writing can be about as excruciating as listening to a recording of your own voice. Sometimes what I write makes me cringe, and then I try to un-cringe it with a more casual or distanced or ironic phrasing, and that somehow makes it even worse. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The second motivation has to do with the way in which this blog forces me to organize and clarify my thinking. The book miniatures help me keep track of what I’m reading and make me read differently, i.e., more actively. The Ling 101 posts (which will soon get to a point where they actually start being interesting for myself) help me figure out at a very basic level what my research is about. Other posts just help me develop an idea for the sake of it. It’s all very helpful. There is also the fact that putting your thoughts in some sort of (in principle) public place immediately makes them seem more important than they actually are, which would probably help me feel better about myself if I weren’t aware of the fact that it would have this effect if I weren’t aware of it. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I usually do not think much about anyone reading this blog. But if you are reading this (and apparently you are): hi! Glad you’re here.</p>
