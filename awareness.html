<p><b>Awareness</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>A rather trivial thought that crossed my mind during meditation the other day, and for some reason has stayed with me.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I used to believe that being aware of what’s going on in your mind was always a net positive. I don’t think of it so much as a piece of mental health advice (although you probably could) but as a moral imperative. The only honesty I’ve always believed in without reservation is honesty with yourself. Acknowledge how you really feel, what you really think, why you really act a certain way. Don’t make up stories to make yourself feel better about the kind of person you are; the greatest sin is <i>la mauvaise foi</i>. Plenty of emotions are not dignified to have, and we do many of the things we do for reasons that are deeply humiliating. The least you can do is tell them to your face. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>All of this assumes that becoming aware of something is like turning on the light in a dark room and suddenly discovering the outrageous mischief that has been going on in there. That may be an inadequate metaphor. Emotions are like Schrödinger’s cat; they’re neither one thing nor another until you observe them. What we call becoming aware of a mental fact doesn’t mean that you observe the fact as it is but that you turn it into a different sort of object. By definition, you cannot become conscious of something that is unconscious, because once it has entered your consciousness, it is no longer unconscious and might not actually resemble the original unconscious thought in any meaningful way. Essentially, the unconscious is the thing in itself. Becoming aware of something and making up stories is the same thing, and true stories are those that are internally consistent and don’t trigger cognitive dissonance. Maybe there is still value in coming up with stories that are true in that sense, but I don’t see why (except, I suppose, for mental health reasons, but who cares). </p>
