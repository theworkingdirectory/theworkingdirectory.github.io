<p><b>Book miniatures: Cooper (ed.), <i>Li Po and Tu Fu</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>My New Year’s resolution this year was to impose a diversity requirement on my reading list: every fourth book I read must be by a non-White or non-Western author. Here’s something that came out of that.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is an anthology of the two most famous poets of the T’ang era, and perhaps the two most famous Chinese poets of all time. It comes with a comprehensive yet reader-friendly introduction that places Li Po and Tu Fu in their historical, literary and philosophical context, a primer on Chinese rhyme and metre, and a commentary on each poem that clarifies all the numerous quotations, allusions and obscure references. The selection of poems offers variety without being overwhelming. In short, Cooper really tried. And yet, I had a hard time connecting to this. I like to think of myself as multicultural and globalized and as someone who already has a fairly diverse reading list, but reading 8th-century poetry from a culture with which I have virtually no personal experience served as a healthy reminder that I still inhabit a very particular corner of the universe. It’s not that Li Po’s and Tu Fu’s work is in any way shocking or outrageous or even strictly speaking weird. It’s rather that I found it somewhat boring and mildly baffling, like, <i>so what</i>. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The following is, according to Cooper, the best known of all Chinese poems. (He adds: <i>The reader will probably succeed in getting a friendly Chinese waiter to say it, in his own dialect.</i> The edition is from 1973. It was a different time.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Quiet night thoughts </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Before my bed </p>
<p>there is bright moonlight</p>
<p>So that it seems </p>
<p>like frost on the ground. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Lifting my head </p>
<p>I watch the bright moon,</p>
<p>Lowering my head </p>
<p>I dream that I’m home. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is nice. But, really? The best known of all Chinese poems? Here’s another one (both of them are by Li Po, who will surely forgive me the copyright infringement):</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Abandon</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>With wine I sit</p> 
<p>absent to Night, till </p>
<p>(Fallen petals</p>
<p>in folds of my gown)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I stagger up </p>
<p>to stalk the brook’s moon:</p>
<p>The birds are gone</p>
<p>and people are few!</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I actually kind of like this one, but still. I was expecting more, although I’m not sure of what. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Some of the poems in the book pose more obvious challenges. Many are, for some reason, full of place names, about sailing on this particular river past this particular mountain, etc. There are the historical allusions, the symbolism, the jokes, all dutifully explained by Cooper, but still creating a layer of opacity between the text and me, like subtitles in a film, but worse. On those poems I gave up altogether. But the ones I quoted above seem so simple but are elusive nonetheless. Is it the translation? Or is it just that I don’t know what the moon looks like in China?</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But then the question is whether any of this is really the point. Robert Frost has also always left me cold (no pun intended). I’m moderately bored and mildly baffled by plenty of stuff. And here’s one I genuinely enjoyed, a late poem by Tu Fu: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Night thoughts afloat </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>By bent grasses</p> 
<p>in a gentle wind</p>
<p>Under straight mast </p>
<p>I’m alone tonight,</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And the stars hang</p> 
<p>above the broad plain </p>
<p>But moon’s afloat </p>
<p>in this Great River:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Oh where’s my name</p>
<p>among the poets?</p>
<p>Official rank? </p>
<p>‘Retired for ill-health.’</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Drifting, drifting, </p>
<p>what am I more than </p>
<p>A single gull </p>
<p>between sky and earth?</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’m looking for something on which to blame my lack of understanding and connection, and I want to blame it on the Chinese-ness, because that would make sense. The Chinese-ness is a barrier to be overcome; that’s why I’m here in the first place. This is my own personal DEI training. I expected to get something out of this, but that expectation is just standing in my way. Instead, I’d rather just see this book as a collection of random texts, by two very random guys who lived a very long time ago in a very far away land, and some of those texts I actually kind of liked. Maybe I can get a friendly Chinese waiter to say them for me. </p>
