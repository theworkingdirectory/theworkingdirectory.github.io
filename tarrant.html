<p>This is a slim volume, readable, fun, not an introduction to the field but rather a critical assessment of its past, present and future. For those who would like an introduction: textual criticism is a branch of classical philology that is concerned with reconstructing, to the extent possible, nothing more and nothing less than the original text itself. We have no autographs from Graeco-Roman antiquity, only later manuscripts that are removed from the original by several layers of manual copying, a process as prone to errors as anything. For some texts, only a handful of manuscripts are preserved, for others hundreds, which might differ from each other in hundreds of different places. The task of the textual critic is to collate the extant sources, compare them line by line, and try to establish a text that can reasonably be considered the root of them all.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is a method to the madness, established by classicists over the decades: scribes are known to make certain copying errors rather than others (very fun overlaps with psycholinguistics here), certain changes are more likely to occur in one direction than the other, there are rules of thumb for evaluating different readings, etc. But as Tarrant doesn’t tire to point out, textual criticism is an art rather than a science. More often than not, it is a matter of persuasiveness of argument rather than hard proof; little in the field can be known for certain. Tarrant is particularly interested in the sociology of textual criticism, the way it is subject to changing trends, the rhetoric it employs. One of the shifting tides he documents is the field's attitude towards scribes who deliberately alter their source material, once considered a pernicious, contagious, fraudulent malpractice but now increasingly viewed in the context of reader-response theory and <i>Überlieferungsgeschichte</i>. From this perspective, the text is no longer the property of the author alone but a collaborative project of authors, scribes, editors and readers, spanning millennia.  </p>
