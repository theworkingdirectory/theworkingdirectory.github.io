<p><b>Book miniatures: Anfam, <i>Abstract Expressionism</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This seems to be the second post in a row about why I can’t really write about the book that the post is supposed to be about. I'm also just incredibly tired, so it's a short one.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’m not comfortable talking about art, let alone writing about it. I’m not generally prone to modesty, I have zero impostor syndrome and, as this blog attests, I’m perfectly comfortable lecturing the world on a wide variety of subjects, but when it comes to the visual arts I always feel like a first-gen student at an Ivy League college. I once read somewhere that as a humanities student you don’t so much learn things as you acquire a certain way of talking about them. There’s plenty of things in linguistics, philosophy or literature that I’m factually ignorant about to at least some degree but that I could talk about nonetheless (for better or for worse). But I’m not sure I have a way of talking about abstract expressionism. I have a hard time even explaining why I chose to read a book about it. (Very roughly: I suppose I just like the roughness, the energy, the presence of the brushstroke on the canvas, the empty space? Are those good reasons? Are they enough?)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I used to listen to a podcast called the Medieval Grad Podcast, which interviews grad students in Medieval Studies about their research projects. The target audience are mainly other grad students in Medieval Studies. It’s obviously nerdy as hell, but the reason I liked it was that it didn’t try to present the basics of an academic field to a lay audience in a nicely packaged and simplified way, as many podcasts do, but gave you a sense of what questions researchers are actively working on, where the controversies are, what keeps people awake at night. (I remember an interesting episode on serfdom that discussed the broader notion of unfreedom, which turns out to be a hugely complex and contested concept that takes many different forms across human societies. Which makes perfect sense, but wasn’t something I had on my radar.) Reading Anfam did something similar for me. These are the things people have opionions about. These are the issues they disagree on. These are the words they use. It sounds shallow, but it’s not. (I think?) </p>
