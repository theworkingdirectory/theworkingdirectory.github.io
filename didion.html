<p><b>Book miniatures: Didion, <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>The term is in full swing, so we’re back to a true miniature format. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>In 2003, Joan Didion’s daughter Quintana is hospitalized with pneumonia, which later develops into life-threatening septic shock. Shortly afterwards, with Quintana still in a coma, Didion’s husband John dies of a heart attack. Just a few weeks later, Quintana is hospitalized again. Her condition is critical; her eventual recovery takes months. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It is not a year you would wish on anyone. One of the curious things about <i>The Year of Magical Thinking</i>, Didion’s memoir of that time, is that you never feel sorry for her. For a text dealing with loss and grief, and perhaps the most painful event in the author’s life, it is strangely detached. Didion’s account of her experience is precise, detailed, lucid. She soberly analyzes the cognitive distortions she observes in herself during this period, the eponymous magical thinking: immediately after John’s death, she muses that, because of the time difference, he must still be alive on the West Coast; she refuses to give away his shoes because he might still need them.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I once read that we shouldn't think of anxiety as a feeling. It manifests as a feeling, but what it really is is a behaviour that we call worrying, ruminating, trying to anticipate and prevent every conceivable adversity. Didion's book made me wonder whether we also should think of grief not as a feeling but rather as an attempt to cognitively fix a world that is out of joint, and only secondarily the emotional fallout thereof. Didion’s response to her loss is, in its essence: <i>This can’t be true. This doesn’t make sense.</i> She’s like a scientist whose theory has been undermined by an unexpected finding, and who now desperately tries to find a way for the theory to still be true, for the world to still make sense. </p>
