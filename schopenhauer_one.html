<p><b>Book miniatures: Schopenhauer, <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (vol. I)</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This book is in two parts. The second part, added by Schopenhauer in a later edition, contains a series of comments and supplements to the first. In the interest of keeping my posts to a manageable length, I’m going to treat the two parts separately. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>When I was a child, there was a game we liked to play, which may still be popular today. You take a sheet of paper and start by drawing the head of a person or an animal. Then you fold the sheet so that your drawing is no longer visible and hand it to the next person, who, not having seen the head, adds shoulders, chest and arms, folds it again, hands it to the next person, and so on. The result is a hybrid creature made up of disparate, incompatible parts, which, for a child, is tremendously funny. I thought of these monsters when I read Schopenhauer’s <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>. It is a book that has a Kantian head, vitalist shoulders, Platonic arms, a Romantic belly and Buddhist legs, and is about as strange and incongruent as this sounds.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Beginning with the head, Schopenhauer largely subscribes to Kantian transcendental idealism, that is, the idea that the world, as we see it, is just that, the world as we see it. While Kant does not deny the existence of a mind-independent reality, he argues that our senses do not give us direct access to this reality itself, the <i>Ding an sich</i>, but only provide us with an image of the world that is shaped by our own perceptual and mental capacities. Space and time are not properties of the world outside us, but properties of the way in which we perceive the world. So far, this gives us the second part of the book’s title – the world as representation. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Where Schopenhauer begins to diverge from Kant is when it comes to the nature of the underlying empirical reality outside of us, or in other words, what the world is other than representation. Instead of adopting Kant’s <i>noumenon</i>, Schopenhauer posits that the thing in itself is the will, a term that he uses in a broader sense to refer not only to the desire, longing and craving that keep humans going but also to its somewhat more obscure equivalent in non-human animals, to a more general <i>élan vital</i> that pervades all forms of life, and even to the various powers and forces that Schopenhauer sees at work in physics and chemistry: magnetism, gravity, and so on. (The idea that all of nature, animate and inanimate, is permeated by invisible forces and drives is one of the parts of the book that hasn’t aged particularly well.) Everything, including ourselves, is fundamentally a single power, the will, which wills nothing in particular and wills on in eternity simply for willing’s sake. As soon as a particular desire – say, to eat – is satisfied, the will immediately finds itself a new target – say, sleep – and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. The will itself, by its very nature, can never be satisfied. Why the will is the underlying nature of all things is, according to Schopenhauer, obvious and doesn’t need any further justification. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>We fold the page and now Schopenhauer brings Platonic ideas into the picture. Ideas seem to sit somehow between the world as representation and the world as will and it is not particularly clear why we need them, except that a) Schopenhauer apparently really likes Plato, and b) the discussion of ideas allows him to get into aesthetics, which a complete philosophical system like the one he is trying to set up must of course include. The true purpose of art, according to Schopenhauer, is to represent ideas, which is obvious, and true art can obviously only be created by the archetypal Romantic genius, a species that Schopenhauer sharply distinguishes from the common people, the herd, <i>diese Fabrikwaare der Natur, wie sie solche täglich hervorbringt</i> (this factory product of nature, as it produces them daily), which is far too narrow-minded and vulgar to appreciate the work of the genius. (I should point out here that Schopenhauer seems to have been an undeniably arrogant, pretentious and obnoxious character, who thought pretty much every other philosopher, dead or alive, was an idiot and charlatan and <i>Windbeutel</i>, and who makes Nietzsche and Thoreau look like good-natured, sociable fellows by comparison.) There are lengthy quotes from Schopenhauer’s favourite artists, lengthier discussions of the relative merits of different art forms, and lengthiest ridicule of amateurs and philistines. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Having survived all this, we get back to the will. In the final section, Schopenhauer regurgitates what are essentially the Four Noble Truths, or at least the first three of them. First, all life is suffering; the world is essentially a miserable place with only brief and fleeting moments of happiness, which ultimately always turn out to be an illusion. Second, the root of all suffering is desire, i.e., will, since suffering means not having what you want (or, in the more interesting fringe case of suffering usually called boredom, not having anything to want). Third, the antidote to suffering is the extinction of desire, the renunciation of all worldly pleasures, with Schopenhauer ultimately advocating straightforward asceticism. (He still allows for the enjoyment of art, which again sits a little uncomfortably in this section, but whatever.) Schopenhauer is often credited with being the first Western philosopher (and for a long time the only one) to draw heavily and explicitly on classical Vedic thought (or any non-Western philosophy, for that matter), which might feel genuinely progressive until you read Schopenhauer’s repeated claims that he was the first to have put the idea of the extinction of the will down in writing, since in the Vedas it was still shrouded in myth and hence not proper philosophy. Colonialism always wins. Be that as it may, we’re not done yet – the last section also contains proof that the notions of good and evil, justice and injustice, and indeed all of moral and political philosophy, can be derived from the will, because the system. Must. By all. Means. Be. Complete! </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Obviously, I’m not a fan. However, despite my rather reductionist treatment of Schopenhauer so far, he does have his moments, some poignant psychological insights into the way in which we deal with the suffering that is an irreducible fact of human existence and with which he seems to have been so well acquainted. At one point he observes that we sometimes encounter a desire that cannot be fulfilled but cannot be abandoned either – say, an unhappy love – and that this single experience can come to dominate us to the point where it eclipses all other sources of suffering and makes us, as it were, impenetrable to the smaller vicissitudes of life. Which, he concludes drily, is at least a more dignified mode of existence. It happens to me more often than I would admit that I find myself feeling moody, morose, afflicted by <i>Weltschmerz</i>, going through some sort of existential crisis, only to realize that I’m just low on blood sugar. This is not dignified. I want to have a good reason for my suffering, something big and meaningful. I occasionally have daydreams in which people I know treat me in ways that are objectively mean and unfair and that make me angry, and these daydreams are weirdly enjoyable. What is happening here is that I already feel that I’m treated unfairly for some reason, but I also recognize that rationally speaking, my anger is not proportionate to the small acts of unfairness that I actually experience in my life. What I want is for reality to provide an appropriate source for the emotions I already have. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’ve talked about Schopenhauer as essentially a terrible person, but I feel for him. His work, which he cared about so much, wasn’t well received for most of his life, and he seems to have had a hard time being liked. One of the jarring incongruities of <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i> is that it ends up being a philosophy of reconciliation and love. Since the will is only one, though it realizes itself in different beings, all differences between people exist only on the level of representation, they are illusion, <i>maya</i>. Underlyingly, on the level of the will, we are all one. To harm another person in order to gain an advantage yourself is, from this perspective, nonsensical; the harm you do is done to the will that you are yourself. Any Buddhist teacher will tell you the same but it’s odd to hear it from Schopenhauer, who seems to have hated so intensely virtually all realizations of the will that weren’t himself. But perhaps there is no paradox at all. Schopenhauer taught the philosophy that he knew he was in need of, he fought so hard to have it recognized because he knew it would have saved him, and he struggled to tear down the barriers between himself and the rest of the world but his struggling made them only more impenetrable. And I can easily rant about Schopenhauer as someone who’s just piecing together bits of philosophy he found elsewhere and rants about other philosophers, or I can give up my struggle to master and be on top of this book and reduce it to stuff I’ve read before. But then there’s Nietzsche, and that’s another story.
