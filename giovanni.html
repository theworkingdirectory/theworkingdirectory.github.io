<p><b>Book miniatures: Baldwin, <i>Giovanni’s Room</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Here’s a way to summarize this novel. A young American man, David, moves to Paris. Despite having had some sexual encounters with men in the past, he still maintains a façade of heterosexual masculinity. In Paris, he recruits an American fiancée, but while she is out of town, he falls for a young Italian bartender, Giovanni. Their love affair is brief, their existence tenuous, their room squalid. The situation worsens when Giovanni is wrongly accused of theft by the gay patron of the bar where he works and whose advances he has kept on rejecting, and suddenly finds himself without an income. When David’s fiancée returns to Paris, he leaves Giovanni. Already teetering on the brink of breakdown – financially, emotionally, physically –, Giovanni eventually murders his ex-employer. David confesses his love for Giovanni to his fiancée; she leaves him. The novel ends the night before Giovanni’s execution. For David, the way forward is unclear. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It is tempting to read <i>Giovanni’s Room</i> in a particular way: as a manifesto for gay rights that accuses 20th-century Western societies of repressing homosexual desire and advocates for liberation. This isn’t a wrong way of reading the text, but I don’t think it exhausts it. I don’t mean to deny the importance of the LGBTQ movement and of what it has achieved and everything, but it feels odd to say that if David and Giovanni only had the right to live their love openly, get married and file their taxes jointly, all would be well in Baldwin’s world. It’s more like David’s struggle with his homosexuality is just the particular form that his existential struggle as a human being takes. In a previous post about <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, I complained that what Kundera claims are timeless human universals is actually just the experience of some very specific people living in a very specific society. With Baldwin, it is the other way around. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So here’s what I felt this novel is about. It is, above all, about fear, about two kinds of fears. One is the fear of losing yourself in another person, of losing control, of being forever stuck and emprisonned in a tiny squalid room. It’s the fear of annihilation, of being sucked into something that you have no power over. The other is the fear of not being able to lose oneself, not being able to love. That whatever happens, you yourself still remain. </p>
