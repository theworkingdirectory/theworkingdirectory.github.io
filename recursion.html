<p><b>Recursion</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>A few years ago I had a panic attack in which I became terrified of the fact that every thought I had immediately became the object of another thought, which became the object of another thought, and so on. I was stuck in an uncontrollable spiral of recursive abstraction, where each new level of abstraction was simply the movement of turning a thought into a thought of a thought, or, relatively speaking, an <i>intentio prima</i> into an <i>intentio secunda</i>. This is simply the movement of <i>différance</i>, but what scared me in this moment wasn’t even the absence of an object language, of some pure presence that is not itself a trace of something else, but the fact that any thought has the power to turn everything, whatever it is, into whatever this thought is about – which is logically a different object – and thus to destroy the original. All of this made me dizzy, the way you feel dizzy in a room covered entirely in mirrors, where everything is a reflection of a reflection of a reflection. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In writing this blog, I often feel that I’m commenting on a something I’ve thought before, which was itself a comment; that I’m writing my own personal Talmud. There’s a scene in Beckett, I can’t remember which play, where a character sits on the stage and peels away layers and layers of an onion, trying to find the core. I’d sometimes like to peel away layers and layers of text to see if there’s a world underneath, however small. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In an earlier post on Plato, I wrote that talking to others limits your thinking, narrows you down, makes you one person and not another. Only when you’re alone can you become a multitude. There’s another angle on this question, which comes from Davidson: only by talking to others can you have a world. Only when you refer to the same thing in the world that I refer to does it truly become a thing in the world, something outside your own head, the reference an <i>intentio prima</i>. The world is defined as those things to which we both can refer. Soliloquy inevitably turns into a recursive spiral. When you’re alone, you can think anything, but there is nothing to think <i>about</i> other than your own thoughts, and any attempt to make sense of the experience only pulls you deeper into the spiral.  </p>
