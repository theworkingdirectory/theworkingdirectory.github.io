<p><b>Book miniatures: Smith, <i>The Promise of Artificial Intelligence: Reckoning and Judgment</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’m not usually in the business of writing blurb-style reviews, but this book fundamentally changed the way I think about AI. Let’s start by clarifying what <i>The Promise of Artificial Intelligence</i> doesn’t do: it doesn’t try to resolve what machines qua machines, as opposed to humans qua humans, can and cannot do, which is refreshing. Consciousness may not necessarily need a biological substrate, and we do not know how powerful the machines of the future will be. Smith is simply concerned with what current-day AI can and cannot do. His verdict: AI falls short of true human intelligence in one crucial respect. It doesn’t have judgment; it has only what Smith, perhaps somewhat infelicitously, calls reckoning, or what we might call calculation.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Smith’s concept of judgment is linked to his concept of the world, understood against a Heideggerian background. The world is the raw, unfiltered reality that our perceptions and cognitions are an imperfect model of. It is the pure acoustic stream that our minds turn into phonemes and words and sentences. It is what we try to grasp but what always, inevitably, slips through our fingers. Smith points out that second-wave AI is very much part of what informs this picture of reality. The main reason why first-wave AI failed was the discrete ontology that was baked into it, the assumption that the world consists of a finite set of medium-sized objects like chairs and apples and people. Second-wave AI starts with the idea that the world is an unordered mess, and that transforming it into a finite set of medium-sized objects is a large part of what intelligence is all about.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>While the world is thus strictly out of reach, we can have a sense of the gap between our registrations and the world itself – that there is a lack, a mismatch, something we fail to register. <i>To know an object as an object is to know that it exceeds your grasp.</i> In a rather ingenious terminological choice, Smith argues that we are deferential to the world: when our registrations of the world clash with the world, the world always wins. This is not an accurate description of how people always behave, but a standard by which we hold adults accountable in most contexts. We are not prisoners of our registrations but committed to a world that is out there, a world that matters to us. Something is at stake.  </p>


<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Judgment, to return to the original point, is the ability to adjust our registration schemes when we feel that they fail to adequately represent the world. It is not a mechanical process that could be reduced to some sort of algorithm. Like Gadamer’s concept of taste, judgment is the ability to navigate competing demands without a clear roadmap, to determine what needs to be prioritized over what. AI doesn’t have judgment because AI doesn’t have a world. AI has registrations and it may even be able to represent those registrations qua registrations, but it has no sense that there is something that is being registered, let alone that it is in any way committed to what is being registered. AI is a prisoner of its registrations, and this is not a shortcoming that can be solved, as Smith puts it, with more of the same: more data, more computational resources, more supervised fine-tuning. Until a more qualitative shift happens, AI will remain blind to what we experience every day, whether with wonder or frustration: the unsurpassable, unfathomable richness of the world. </p>
