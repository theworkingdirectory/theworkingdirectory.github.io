<p><b>Book miniatures: Cicero, <i>Catilinarians</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Catiline is back! I wrote about Sallust’s <i>De coniuratione Catilinae</i> in an earlier post and decided that I didn’t have enough of late-republican plotting and scheming. The Catilinarians are a series of four speeches that Cicero delivered during the famous, and famously unsuccessful, coup d’état that aimed to relieve the senate of its duties and place the ambitious Catiline at the head of the ex-republic in spe. However, knowing Cicero, I should have anticipated that the speeches are hardly about Catiline at all. They are, of course, about Cicero. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>As a quick refresher, Catiline is a Roman nobleman previously largely known for general-purpose debauchery who at some point hits upon the idea that it would be fun to rule Rome. Aspiring dictators were a dime a dozen in Rome at the time, but Catiline is as capable as he is ruthless and he attracts a sizeable following. In the year of Cicero’s consulship, the conspirators get serious. Cicero soon learns of their plans – which also include an attack on his own life –, but can’t prove a thing. After he has at least forced Catiline himself to leave the city, he finally gets his hands on firm evidence of the conspiracy and can arrest the key figures (excluding, however, Catiline). Throughout the whole affair, Cicero finds himself in a pickle – legally, politically, ethically. Roman law leaves him with little room to manoeuvre against the conspirators, who are after all Roman citizens. The choice he faces is whether to obey the law and risk the Republic falling into the hands of an autocrat, or to protect the Republic by acting against its own laws.</p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Luckily, as far as Cicero is concerned, he handles the situation excellently. His outsized and yet easily bruised ego is on prominent display in his other works as well, but in the <i>Catilinarians</i>, his self-congratulatory tone reaches new heights. He does not shy away from comparing himself to Scipio Africanus, Marius, Pompey, even Romulus himself, and repeatedly makes it clear that military triumphs are not nearly as impressive as saving the Republic from internal enemies. It is not an overstatement to say that in Cicero’s view, the suppression of Catiline’s conspiracy is the most momentous event in Rome’s history since its founding. And what does he ask of the Roman people in return? Really nothing – just to be remembered forever as a hero and bringer of peace. To be clear, I’m not anti-Cicero at all. The fact that the arguably greatest Latin stylist of all time was also a very flawed and fallible human being who could be hilariously petty at times makes me like him even more.</p>
