<p><b>Book miniatures: Tanahashi and Levitt (ed.), <i>The Essential Dogen</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Yet another book that isn’t particularly easy to write about. I decided that the most appropriate format for this post would be to simply comment on some short excerpts.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>


<p><i>Zhaozhou, Great Master Zhenji, asked a newly arrived monk, “Have you been here before?”</i> </p>
<p><i>The monk said, “Yes, I have been here.” </i></p>
<p><i>Zhaozhou said, “Have some tea.”</i> </p>
<p><i>Later he asked another monk, “Have you been here before?”</i> </p>
<p><i>The monk said, “No, I have not been here.” </i></p>
<p><i>Zhaozhou said, “Have some tea.” </i></p>
<p><i>The temple director then asked Zhaozhou, “Why do you say ‘Have some tea’ to someone who has been here and ‘Have some tea’ to someone who has not?”</i> </p>
<p><i>Zhaozhou said, “Director.” </i> </p>
<p><i>“Yes?”, replied the Director. </i> </p>
<p><i>Zhaozhou said, “Have some tea.”</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The simple message of the story: be kind to everyone, regardless of whether they are a long-time companion, a stranger or the temple director. But this message is something that Zhaozhou could explain to the temple director; he could simply answer his question, but he does not. Inviting him for tea instead is an answer of sorts, but a refusal to answer at the same time. Why does Zhaozhou give an answer-non-answer?  </p>

<p>Have some tea. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Mountains’ walking is just the same as human walking. Accordingly, do not doubt mountains’ walking even though it does not look the same as human walking.</i> </p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>It is actually the same as human walking. It is just different.   </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Once, Caoshan was asked by a monk, “When it is hot, where should we go to escape the heat?” Caoshan said, “Escape into the cauldron on burning charcoal.” The monk said, “How do you escape into the cauldron on burning charcoal?” Caoshan said, “No suffering can reach there.” </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>To accept suffering, even to embrace it, is to be free from it. But then, the old problem: to get into the cauldron you must want to escape suffering, but to get into the cauldron you must want to accept suffering.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>There are mountains hidden in treasures. There are mountains hidden in swamps. There are mountains hidden in the sky. There are mountains hidden in mountains. There are mountains hidden in hiddenness. This is how we study.  </i></p>

<p><i>An ancient Buddha said: “Mountains are mountains, waters are waters.” These words do not mean mountains are mountains; they mean mountains are mountains.</i>  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is meaning hidden in these words. There is meaning hidden in meaning. There are words hidden in meaning.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>There is no self – no place to hide in the all-inclusive world. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The irony: if the self were a hiding place, what would be hiding inside of it? The real self, the self’s self? Or the absence of a self? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Snow</i>  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>All my life, false and real, right and wrong entangled.</i> </p>
<p><i>Playing with the moon, ridiculing wind, listening to birds,</i> </p>
<p><i>many years were wasted seeing the mountains covered in snow.</i> </p>
<p><i>This winter, I suddenly realize snow makes a mountain. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
