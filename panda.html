<p><b>Book miniatures: Gould, <i>The Panda's Thumb</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Occasionally I read a book for fun. This was one of them. I really enjoyed Gould’s <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, so when I found <i>The Panda’s Thumb</i> in our neighbour’s Little Free Library, I couldn’t resist. Gould, a palaeontologist by trade and perhaps one of the most influential figures in 20th-century evolutionary theory, had a monthly column in <i>Natural History</i> magazine for many years. <i>The Panda’s Thumb</i> is a collection of some of those short essays, which are both bursting with knowledge and unfailingly entertaining. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Gould’s essays often start with a small and quirky empirical data point, but then draw a broader lesson from it. This is the case, for example, with the eponymous panda’s thumb, which the reader learns is not really a proper thumb at all. It’s a sixth finger, developed from a bone that was in no way finger-related in the panda’s evolutionary ancestors. But the panda’s exclusively bamboo-based diet requires more manual dexterity than the original paws could provide (think how tricky it is to hold the stems), and instead of converting one of the original five fingers into a Homo sapiens-style opposable thumb, the panda recruited an extra bone. The broader lesson? The panda’s non-thumb is an imperfect solution to a real problem. It is clumsy and awkward, and it has no real advantage over a proper, fifth-finger thumb. And that is precisely what makes it interesting, Gould argues. The best evidence for evolution are not cases of perfect design which could just as easily have been conceived by a highly intelligent watchmaker, but flaws in the system, imperfections, bugs. God would not have created a less-than-optimal thumb, but evolution certainly would. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Not only is Gould dead set against creationism, but also against various versions of evolutionary theory that he believes have taken a wrong turn. In <i>Shades of Lamarck</i>, he attacks the common practice of associating any effects of the environment on genetic material – which nowadays are pretty much undisputed – with Lamarckism. Lamarck’s theory, he argues, was fundamentally a theory of directed variation. In the classic Lamarckian scenario, if giraffes try really hard to reach for the trees, their necks will gradually get longer, a change that will then be passed on to the next generation and improve their fitness. But the real-world scenarios are different. If radioactive material increases the rate of mutations, this does indeed affect heredity, but this change is not adaptive. Increased mutations do not improve an individual’s fitness in a radioactive environment. No truly Lamarckian case of directed variation has ever been attested. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>A number of other essays deal with the topic for which Gould is arguably still most famous, namely, the debate between gradualism and punctuated equilibrium. We often think of evolution as unfolding slowly and steadily at a truly geological rate, with tiny random mutations accumulating over time. But Gould points out that the puzzle then becomes why the palaeontological record offers so little evidence of intermediate species. Instead, he proposes that evolution proceeds in short bursts with long periods of stasis in between, an idea that has been met with fierce resistance from some of his colleagues. There is of course an empirical fact of the matter, but Gould doesn’t fail to note that it also has a political dimension: he himself is a staunch leftist who argues for the radical, revolutionary nature of evolutionary change; his opponents are conservatives who insist that change in nature happens gradually, without violent upheavals. Unlike so many others, Gould does not pretend that science happens in a political vacuum but is inevitably shaped by the society around it.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Politics is also at play in an essay on Dawkins’ selfish genes. For Gould, the problem with the idea that the true units of selection are not organisms but genes is that selection does not ‘see’ genes. What it does see, or in other words, what survival depends on, are certain features of the organism – longer necks, brighter colors, thicker skin, and so on. If specific genes uniquely coded for specific traits at the level of the organism, Dawkins might be right, but that is not how genes work. No single gene is responsible for longer necks; rather, genes tend to operate in clusters, and individual genes tend to code for more than a single trait. This all boils down to the idea, which I wrote about in an earlier post on Noble’s <i>The Music of Life</i>, that the survival of organisms requires cooperation between genes, just as the survival of societies requires cooperation between individuals. Ultimately, there may be no single level of description that exclusively deserves to be identified as the agent of evolution, and from what I understand of Gould’s Wikipedia article, he did not think there was. His argument is directed not so much against the view that genes are units of selection as against the view that they are the only units of selection. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In general, what he opposes is a blind faith in atomism, reductionism and determinism, i.e., “The idea that wholes should be understood by decomposition into ‘basic’ units; that properties of microscopic units can generate and explain the behavior of macroscopic results; that all events and properties have definite, predictable, determined causes. These ideas have been successful in our understanding of simple objects, made of few components, and uninfluenced by prior history. […] But organisms are much more than amalgamations of genes. They have a history that matters; their parts interact in complex ways. Organisms are built by genes acting in concert, influenced by environments, translated into parts that selection sees and parts that selection does not see.” Dawkins is the kind of obnoxious guy who tells you that <i>actually</i>, organism are just genes, and <i>actually</i>, there is no such thing as society, and there is no God. I really don’t want to get into the whole God issue (it’s getting late), but I generally side with Gould here – higher levels of explanation are not necessarily redundant.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In a similar vein, throughout <i>The Panda’s Thumb</i>, Gould criticizes a mechanistic conception of science, popular with scientists and non-scientists alike, according to which research simply consists of the methodical accumulation of data points, which then allow the researcher to objectively either accept or reject their research hypothesis, in a perfectly predictable, deterministic way. The inductive method is part of science, but so is intuition, inspiration, the moment of eureka. Scientific progress is not gradual but has the structure of punctuated equilibrium, with revolutionary changes interrupting long period of stasis, what Kuhn called normal science. Science is an eminently human activity, and Gould clearly thought it was a whole lot of fun. </p>
