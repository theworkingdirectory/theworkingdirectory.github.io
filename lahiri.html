<p><b>Book miniatures: Lahiri, <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is a book of short stories, each in its own way concerned with how our lives collide with the lives of strangers. Many of Lahiri’s protagonists form fragile and temporary relationships with people they barely know. In <i>When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine</i>, the daughter of Indian immigrants to the U.S. learns that a family friend and frequent dinner guest is from what is then East Pakistan on the brink of war and soon to be Bangladesh. He has not heard from his wife and seven daughters for weeks, who are still somewhere on the subcontinent. The fate of Mr. Pirzada’s family and the outcome of the war soon come to occupy the girl’s so far thoroughly Americanized life. In <i>The Third and Final Continent</i>, a young man newly arrived in the U.S. from India befriends his landlady, a frail centenarian who lives just as much as he does in a world of her own. And in <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i>, a young mother of three on a trip to India divulges some disturbing secrets to a tour guide in a way that feels at once touching and disrespectful. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Other stories are about becoming estranged from the people you expect to be closest to you: lovers, spouses. <i>Temporary Matters</i> is the story of a young married couple who recently lost their unborn child and has been living in mutual isolation ever since. When their power company schedules a one-hour blackout every evening for several days, their relationship seems to rekindle as they share secrets and stories in the dark. But in the end, she breaks up, a move she has been planning for weeks. The young man from <i>The Third and Final Continent</i>, on the other hand, marries a woman his parents have chosen for him, and then finds her to be an unexpected soulmate. <i>Mrs. Sen’s</i>, <i>This Blessed House</i> and <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i> are all stories of people stuck in a marriage with someone who is and will remain utterly opaque to them. We watch them as they begin to fathom the extent to which this will distort their lives.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Lahiri’s stories, it will be clear by now, are also stories about immigration, about being a stranger in a foreign land. But here again, being a stranger does not just mean being behind a barrier. Sometimes, as in <i>Sexy</i>, it is part of the allure. Often, it is something to bond over. Sometimes, as in <i>Interpreter of Maladies</i> but also in <i>Temporary Matters</i>, it opens up a space in which a conversation can take place. A stranger is not a lesser version of a friend. A stranger promises both accountability and complete anonymity, allowing you to be your true self or to become someone else entirely, to be as honest as you have ever been or to indulge in the most outrageous lies, or even both at once. Immigration creates a society in which we operate more at a distance to each other, literally and figuratively speaking, but Lahiri doesn’t seem to be interested in collapsing this distance but in exploring the possibilities it offers. </p>
