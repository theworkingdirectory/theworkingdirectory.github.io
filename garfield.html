<p><b>Book miniatures: Garfield, <i>Losing Ourselves</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I read Jay Garfield’s commentary on Nāgārjuna’s Mūlamadhyamakakārikā a couple of months ago and have been meaning to read some of his other books ever since. I settled on this one more or less randomly. </i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The basic claim of <i>Losing Ourselves</i> fits into a single sentence: we are not selves, but persons. By the notion of the self, Garfield refers to the idea that each individual has a single, atomic, transcendental kernel which guarantees its unity and identity across space and time. Slightly less opaquely speaking, your self is the ultimate answer to the question of who you are: you are not your name, not your job, not your body, not your character, not your thoughts – these are things that you <i>have</i>, and the ‘you’ that has these things is your self. When you imagine what it would be like to be someone else, you imagine transplanting your self into someone else’s body and mind. Your self is what remains constant throughout your life, even if every single molecule in your body had been recycled at some point and if your personality has changed radically. It is by virtue of having a self that all your diverse experiences from the past, present and future cohere into a single point that is you.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The self is taken for granted not only in much philosophical theorizing, both East and West, but also in our everyday intuition. We act and speak <i>as if</i> we had a self. But Garfield argues that the self is an illusion, and he spends this (rather short) book refuting various pro-self arguments and developing an alternative theory. In his view, human beings are <i>persons</i>: not atomic entities but nodes in a complex network of psychophysical and social relations, not some transcendental, primordial beings but roles enacted in a world shared with others. Thus, from a person-centered perspective, the answer to the question of who you are might be: a daughter of a mother and a father, a sister of another woman, a student at a university, a reader of books, and so on. What makes you <i>you</i> is not a single thing that we could point to and that exists in isolation from everything and everyone else, but the relationships in which you stand to the things and people around you.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I had a lot of sympathy for this view already going into this book and I still endorse it without reservation. However, I was left wondering whether Garfield defends it too zealously at times, rejecting ideas that do not threaten his premise. Chapter 5 is devoted to what Garfield calls ‘the minimal self’: a self that is merely the locus or basis of your experience. Part of the reason why Garfield rejects even this more modest notion of the self seems to be the suspicion that its defenders are trying to smuggle in a more contentful self through the back door. This suspicion is not necessarily unwarranted or paranoid, but it seems worthwhile to engage with these views on the assumption that they are held in good faith. I will not go through Garfield’s entire argument in this chapter but only focus on one aspect I struggled with in particular.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>What is at issue here is the notion of reflexivity, the idea that while we are aware of something – say, an apple on the table –, we are also aware of our being aware of the apple. There is an important distinction here, which Garfield doesn’t draw as clearly as I would like him to, between reflexivity proper and what Sartre calls the pre-reflective cogito. (Garfield doesn’t cite Sartre in this context, but since I didn’t read any of the people that he does cite, I will rely on Sartre here who seems to have made pretty much the point Garfield is arguing against.) Reflexivity means taking your own experience as an object, as in an act of deliberate introspection. For instance, you might catch yourself daydreaming while trying to write a blog post, thereby becoming aware of your own thinking. It seems safe to say that reflexivity proper is real, but also that it is a fairly occasional occurrence. You don’t go through life constantly monitoring your own mental activity; if you did, you wouldn’t get anything done. Pre-reflexivity is a different thing. Pre-reflexivity means that while you are focusing on an object of perception or cognition other than yourself – the apple, for example – you are nevertheless in some slight, minimal sense aware of the fact that you are perceiving an apple. The moment you try to focus on pre-reflective awareness it inevitably turns into reflective awareness proper, and thus always slips through your fingers. Pre-reflexivity is an elusive experience, and Garfield simply denies that it exists. This matters for his argument, because, simplifying greatly, if experience doesn’t have the property of always being for someone, for a self, then there is little ground to argue for the existence of such a self as the locus of all experience.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’m not sold on the idea that there is no such thing as pre-reflective awareness of our experience. One way to get at pre-reflexivity might be to think about situations in which it is absent. Suppose you are at a party, talking to some friends while other conversations are going on around you. It is a common experience to suddenly overhear your name – or any other word or phrase you’re primed to react to – being mentioned in one of those conversations that you are not a part of. Crucially, this does not happen because the word that catches your attention is pronounced more audibly or because it is directed at you. Rather, you realize that you have actually been listening to that other conversation for a long time – it’s just that you weren’t aware of it, not even pre-reflectively. What this example gets at is, for one, that there does seem to be a difference between listening to a conversation and knowing that you are doing so, and listening to a conversation while being completely unaware of it. At the same time, however, the example also seems to show that pre-reflexivity is not a necessary component of all our experience. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So where does that leave the self? It might be helpful here to go back to Nāgārjuna, a second to third century Buddhist philosopher who is arguably behind much of Garfield’s reasoning in this book. (The philosopher Garfield relies on more explicitly is Candrakīrti, but since I haven’t read Candrakīrti and since he and Nāgārjuna are broadly part of the same school, I’ll rely on the latter instead.) Nāgārjuna argued that everything exists not absolutely or independently but only conventionally or relationally. A good example of something that everyone would probably agree exists conventionally is money. A ten-dollar bill isn’t just intrinsically a ten-dollar bill. Rather, it is a piece of paper with some ink on it which only <i>becomes</i> a ten-dollar bill because of the broader economic system of which it is a part. The ten-dollar bill depends in its existence <i>qua</i> ten-dollar bill on institutions such as banks, on certain legal regulations, and also on people like me and you treating it as a ten-dollar bill to buy and sell things. Many things very obviously exist conventionally, such as college degrees, recreational drugs or wildlife sanctuaries. The much more radical claim that Nāgārjuna defends is that everything – from trees and tables to proteins and molecules – exists in the same way, that is, only conventionally, not independently of anything else.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Garfield, in <i>Losing Ourselves</i>, is not concerned with this claim as a whole but only insofar as it concerns our own mode of existence. His argument that we are not selves boils down to the claim that we do not exist absolutely, but only conventionally speaking, only in relation to other things: we exist only as persons. I fully agree. But going back to our problem of intermittent but arguably real pre-reflexivity, it is not clear to me that a self defined as the locus or basis of experience could not also exist conventionally. Just in case that someone might call a conventionally existing self an oxymoron, I will use the term selfity instead, also to emphasize the fact that this might be a very silly idea. Selfity would be a feature of (some of) our experience, and as such it would exist only in relation to the structure of our experience as a whole. Some experiences would simply be of the kind such that it feels like there is a persistent self having them. I agree that the details of such a notion of self(-ity) would have to be worked out, but I do not see that acknowledging the existence of pre-reflexivity immediately forces us to posit a transcendental self of the sort that Garfield attacks. </p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Since this book miniature is way too long already, I’ll resist the urge to ramble on about selfity. Judging from Garfield’s references, a roughly similar view seems to have been proposed by Thomas Metzinger, who immediately made it almost to the top of my reading list. Post should be coming up soon(-ish).  </p>
