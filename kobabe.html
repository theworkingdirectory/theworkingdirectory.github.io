<p><b>Book miniatures: Kobabe, <i>Gender Queer</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>This is the first graphic novel I’ve ever read. (Some people, including probably Kobabe emself, would be shocked by this confession. A note that Kobabe uses <i>e</i>/<i>em</i> pronouns. I had to look up the reflexive.) <i>Gender Queer</i> is a memoir about growing up as a non-binary person and holds the record for being the book most frequently banned from school libraries in 2021–2022. I suspect that much of it has to do with the fact that it doesn’t just address LGBTQ+ issues and contains some fairly explicit material, but also does so in a visual style that many would associate with children’s comics. It isn’t a children’s comic, it’s a graphic novel, and it should be in every school library. It’s honest, fun, creative as hell, and it gets its point across. (Though it will not turn me into a graphic novel aficionado. Why have pictures if you could have text? I don’t get it.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Like many kids these days, I occasionally ponder whether to identify as trans or non-binary, and reading <i>Gender Queer</i> triggered another one of those reflections. I don’t think that that those are the right labels – I have no issues with being in a female body. However, I do very much dislike the social aspects of being a woman, in particular being a woman around other women. I have no issues with men (<i>qua</i> men, that is). I’m not denying patriarchy as a societal fact, but my personal experience of sex-based discrimination is extremely limited. Ninety percent of all the friends I’ve ever had have been male. I like men, and men tend to like me, or at least more than women do. My issue with women is the constant pressure they exert on each other to be friendly, polite and gregarious. On the whole, women are much less forgiving of social blunders committed by other women. All-female spaces are uncomfortable and stress me out. This all might sound like internalized misogyny, but if anything, it’s just misogyny <i>tout court</i>; it doesn’t include myself. The appeal that switching to some sort of non-female gender identity would hold for me is that it would stop other women from treating me as one of them and holding me to their standards. </p>
