<p><b>Book miniatures: Milton, <i>Paradise Lost</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This post is very late and written in more of a hurry than I would like. I technically have spring break but still no time for anything. I’ve also temporarily given up on writing anything other than book miniatures until the end of term. Excuses aside, here we go.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I can’t say this was an experience I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish, but it’s certainly one I won’t forget. It is (pun intended) one hell of a text. (Quick note: I really can’t be bothered to summarize the plot. I’ll just assume that my imaginary reader is familiar with it.) Being an epic, it doesn’t just want to be the greatest story ever, it wants to contain all the knowledge available at the time. There are entire books in which the story is temporarily put on hold while some angelic figure – first Raphael, then Michael – educates Adam about the creation of the world, Satan’s revolt, the history of mankind after the expulsion from Eden, the coming of the Messiah, the Last Judgment, and everything you always wanted to know about theology but were afraid to ask. Or almost everything. When Adam ends up inquiring at length about some obscure cosmological matters, even Raphael is eventually like, this is really not the point here. (Eve, by the way, is not present during these instructive conversations. She patiently waits to be filled in by Adam later. I’m not easily bothered by misogyny, but Milton elevates it to a whole new level.) </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>


<p>As I skimmed through some of the recent and not-so-recent Miltonian scholarship included in the critical edition I picked up from the library, I felt that one perspective on <i>Paradise Lost</i> remained underappreciated, and that is its place in the tradition of the fantasy novel. Milton’s universe is largely populated by figures who are not humans, but who nonetheless share certain human traits, and developing these figures into authentic and nuanced characters without conflating them with the human protagonists is a nontrivial writing challenge that Milton, in my very humble opinion, doesn’t always handle perfectly. There is, for instance, a lengthy and awkward passage in which Raphael has to explain to Adam, who has invited him to dinner, why angels can in fact consume earthly food, although of course they don’t have to. There is also the fact that the scenes involving God or Jesus are unusually tedious because the two are not exactly well-rounded characters with complex personalities and clear motivations. More generally, it is tempting (pun intended) to draw a parallel between theology and fantasy worldbuilding: the question that both try to answer is what the world has to be like in order for the story you are telling to be plausible and make sense. What would the structure of the physical universe have to be? Why would a predestined state of equilibrium become unbalanced? Would your characters have free will? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The one who redeems (pun intended) <i>Paradise Lost</i> from its intermittent tedium is Satan. Satan is the ultimate antihero, rebellious, ruthless, raging against the unbearable goodness of the good. He’s against everything out of sheer spite, the eternal pubescent teenager. Tortured and torn, his only pleasure is to inflict pain: <i>For only in destroying I find ease / To my relentless thoughts</i>. Of course, the whole point of the text is supposed to be that Satan is ultimately powerless and, even worse, just another cog in God’s machine, unknowingly fulfilling the plan He had all along. One of the supplementary essays I read even argued that the actual whole point of the text is to bring the reader to this conclusion gradually, book by book; that the real plot is the reader’s spiritual development. I didn’t get there. Maybe that’s on me. But I thought Satan was, and remained until the last page, the most convincing case I have ever heard for embracing evil. God, with all due respect, is a bore.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But I’d like to take a dialectic turn here. For Milton gives us only two choices: obey or rebel, thesis or antithesis. The angels who choose not to follow Satan but to remain loyal to God do so not because they are convinced of God’s superior leadership qualities or agree with the broader vision he has for the universe at large, etc. They obey authority because authority must be obeyed. That’s precisely what makes Satan’s uprising so refreshing, but ultimately he’s no better. The obedient angels do what they are supposed to do for the simple reason that they are supposed to do it, and Satan and his followers don’t do what they are supposed to do for the simple reason that they are supposed to do it. Someone who blindly rejects the rules that authority imposes on them is just as unfree as someone who blindly follows them. True freedom means being able to do what you are supposed to do <i>even though</i> you are supposed to do it, which is unfortunately much harder than Satan’s blind adolescent rage.  </p>
