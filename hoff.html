<p><b>Book miniatures: Hoff, <i>The Tao of Pooh</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>The whole reason I read this book in the first place is that I was considering giving it to my father for Christmas. My father likes Winnie-the-Pooh, as do I, and since this is one of the three things we have in common (along with doing the same crossword puzzles and having similar feelings towards my mother’s family), our conversations touch on Winnie-the-Pooh with surprising frequency, for absolutely no other reason than to reassure each other that this is something we both share. And since my father also has a vague interest in philosophy, an introduction to Taoism that is based on Winnie-the-Pooh seemed just what he would enjoy. Having read <i>The Tao of Pooh</i>, I decided that even considering the potential benefit of intergenerational bonding, it wouldn’t be worth my father’s time. It certainly wasn’t worth mine, and I even considered skipping this book miniature, but then decided I couldn’t possibly deprive my devoted readership of my thoughts on this œuvre.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There’s really not much of a summary to get out of the way. Hoff’s basic idea is that Pooh, famously a Bear of Very Little Brain, is essentially a Taoist sage who doesn’t cling, doesn’t fight, doesn’t overthink, lets nature take its course and therefore lives in serene happiness. Repeatedly, it is emphasized that the Tao cannot be explained or grasped intellectually, which may be true, or may be because what Hoff has in mind isn’t a particularly groundbreaking vision and really doesn’t need a whole lot of explaining. Relax. Live in the present. How about being nice to other people sometimes. I suspect even my dad has heard this before, but maybe some people haven’t, so never mind. (The book was apparently a massive bestseller.) </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Oddly enough, though, for a text that aspires to serene happiness, <i>The Tao of Pooh</i> complains an inordinate amount. About the Confucians and the Buddhists. About people who are always busy and don’t pause to relax and live in the present. About capitalism, nuclear war, hamburger stands and microwaves. About people who try to be smart, who try to find out things about the world, who try to use their brains, and about science in general. About the fact that fruit doesn’t taste as good anymore as it used to. About people who exercise a lot (no, I don’t get it either). If the book was published today, it would complain about phones, but since it was published in 1982, it complains about TV. There is a deeply weird scene in which Pooh is lured by an advertisement into buying too many shoes, a plot which goes absolutely nowhere and has no relation to anything whatsover other than the fact that buying too many shoes is apparently another thing that Hoff takes issue with. And while Pooh (with the exception of the shoe business) is the glowing hero of the book, Rabbit, Owl, Eeyore, Tigger and even Piglet are all relentlessly mocked for lacking Pooh’s Taoist wisdom and being prone to various vices and weaknesses. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I just can’t stand the smugness of all of it. One of the things I’ve genuinely worked hard on over the years and that I feel I’ve gotten a bit better at is not judging people all the time. People can be Taoists. People can spend their lives working jobs that I consider meaningless and buying shoes. It’s not really anyone else’s business. Could we all just please leave each other alone. Also, it might not be a particularly important point, but I think that Hoff fundamentally misreads what the Winnie-the-Pooh stories are all about. The fact that Pooh is a Bear of Very Little Brain and does some genuinely stupid things isn’t a manifesto for violent anti-intellectualism. Everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood has flaws: Pooh’s are his limited intellectual capacities and unbridled lust for honey, Eeyore’s is his mopiness, Rabbit’s is his vanity, etc. The point is that this is okay. Hodd would probably send the whole lot to therapy, but they are still friends, they have adventures together and it is precisely their differences that make the stories fun. Milne never pontificates the way that Hoff does, and his books don’t deserve to be turned into this self-help bible about what are the right kinds of emotions to have. I’m sure my father would agree with me.  </p>
