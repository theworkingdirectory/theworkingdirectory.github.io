<p><b>Book miniatures: Wilde, <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Everything about this play is a joke. I’ve never read anything less serious. For a start, it’s about two women who, for completely random and completely unrelated reasons, have decided that the man they marry must be called Earnest, as well as two men who happen to be (distributively) in love with them but unfortunately do not bear the name Earnest, all of which taken together gives rise to the titular pun, which is so bad that it’s almost good. What is more, imagine a play in which every single character talks like Wilde himself. Every page contains at least two quotable aphorisms. For example, here are the ones from page 65 (I promise I selected the page at random): </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>[…] I really don’t see why you should object to the name of Algernon. It is not at all a bad name. In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name. Half of the chaps who get into the Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man. He has never written a single book, so you can imagine how much he knows.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Here’s page 34:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You can’t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice sweet refined girl. What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Wilde’s style is so distinctive that it’s hard not to be tempted to copy it. Which is why I spent about half an hour of my life composing Wilde-style aphorisms and asking ChatGPT whether they were original or not. It caught them all. Even worse, it mercilessly explained why none of them could be by Wilde. (I didn’t reveal myself to be the author – otherwise it probably would have been more polite.) It was very depressing, and I ended up abandoning this post for a few days until I could bring myself to simply present to my audience this record of my failure. As Wilde might have said (but didn’t), the problem with being light-hearted is that it’s such hard work.  </p>
