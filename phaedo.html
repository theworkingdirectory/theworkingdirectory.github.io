<p><b>Book miniatures: Plato, <i>Phaedo</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I read this book over the course of a year, slogging through the Greek, checking the translation for every other sentence, and rarely reading more than two pages at a time. Accordingly, my understanding of the text is haphazard at best, my recollection fragmentary. I feel vaguely obliged to produce something meaningful here; after all, it’s Plato. However, this is my fifth attempt at writing this post and I have a few more in the pipeline that I want to get out, so I’ll just have to go with free association tonight.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I originally considered writing this post in the style of a Platonic dialogue. Which would have been a fun exercise, but I eventually realized that it would require me to actually have some sort of argument to defend. The form of the dialogue might be taken to indicate that the author is open to and engages with other people’s views, rather than just shouting their own personal dogma out into the world. The opposite is true. It is the soliloquy in which you can hesitate, contradict yourself, dwell on your doubts, suddenly abandon the line of argument you have followed, roam free. The dialogue forces you to occupy one place and one place only. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Hannah Arendt once wrote that when you speak, you act as one, but when you think, you become many. I have often found myself in situations where, in conversation with others, I vigorously defend a position on an issue about which I previously had no particularly clear or well-established views, or perhaps even cared much about. This is a standard case of Hegelian difference-precedes-identity dynamics. When you are alone with your thoughts, you contain multitudes, all kinds of different truths; you are everything because nothing has yet distinguished itself from you. One part of you holds one view, another a different one. But when you enter the social world, you invariably draw a distinction between yourself and others: this is the view I have, this is the view he has. You become one.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>We tend to think that talking with others, especially if they hold views different from ours, broadens the mind and makes it more supple and flexible, whereas social isolation leads to a rigid, narrow and radicalized outlook on the world. The opposite can be true. Being exposed to other perspectives often merely reinforces our own. Being alone can mean having the space to let a view you hold loosen its grip on you, allowing you to open up to the multitudes within.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I used to enjoy discussing philosophy when I was in college but I don’t any more. I don’t actually have much to say, and neither do the people I talk to. We’re all just amateurs trying to construct an identity by finding interesting things to disagree about with others. We all want to be like Socrates, convincing our interlocutors of the indubitable truth of our views by the sheer force of logic, and nobody wants to play the role of Simmias or Cebes or any of those minor characters who are largely condemned to endless variations of ‘Yes, Socrates.’ </p>
