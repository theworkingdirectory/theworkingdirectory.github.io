<p><b>Book miniatures: Rumi, <i>Love Is My Saviour</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Love Is My Saviour</i> is a collection of the few dozen poems that the 13th century Persian Sufi mystic Rumi wrote in Arabic, translated by Nesreen Akhtarkhavari and Anthony A. Lee. I won’t comment on the quality of the translation, which I found somewhat clunky (so apparently I am commenting on it, but obviously I speak no Arabic whatsoever and am not qualified to do any translation-related commenting, so I won’t, from now on). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Rumi’s main topic – and the only one in this collection – is love, meaning eros rather than agape, pure, all-consuming Dionysian ecstasy. Most of the time, it is hard to tell whether his poems are about religious fervour or sexual desire; most likely, it’s all the same. Drunkenness is a recurring theme, both literally and metaphorically: <i>There, drunk on wine and drunk on you, I lie. / I love and drink, and when I hate I die.</i> The general vibe is one of unbridled passion; exclamation marks abound. Here’s another snippet:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The Truth walked in, and love fell all around.</i></p>
<p><i>Love found us. We died. So, we settled down. </i></p>
<p><i>Drunk and so full of pride! Shamed when sober!</i></p>
<p><i>The price of love is peace and calm! Tempted,</i></p>
<p><i>we fell. We died. He cared for me, he gave</i></p>
<p><i>me drink, he ravaged me, he cherished me.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The goal is to lose oneself completely, in the beloved, in God, in death, in another cup of wine. It’s all the same. As poetry, its appeal is undeniable. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But here’s the rub. In the proud tradition of people declaring their personal maxims universal law, Rumi has nothing but contempt for anyone who spends their days in any other way than between wine-stained bedsheets: <i>If you’re not in love, life has passed you by.</i> Which, to be honest, I find kind of irritating. Because I’m not in love. (I think. Some people might disagree. But in any case I’m not continually in the throes of unbridled passion.) I don’t feel that life is passing me by, I have very little tolerance for being told how I’m supposed to be happy, and I think that Rumi is just being plain obnoxious. And yet, of course, then I also wonder whether maybe, just a little bit, life is indeed passing me by, and I just refuse to acknowledge it out of pride. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The actually interesting question is whether there is a fact of the matter in the first place. Kierkegaard, writing about the choice between subscribing to or rejecting the Christian faith, noted that either decision only makes sense if it has already been made. Adopting Christianity only makes sense if you are already a Christian, and the same applies to atheism. If you are truly undecided (and it is debatable whether anyone ever is), nothing can guide you in this choice; it is a pure leap of faith. By the same token, Dionysian ecstasy will seem to be the only right way to lead your life if that is the life you are already leading. When you’re drunk, the idea of sobering up is just depressing. But from the outside, all the hangovers and heartbreaks seem kind of inconvenient and just not a smart choice to make. Conversely, Apollonian lucidity is a bliss to experience, but hardly appealing after a drink or two. The point I’m trying to make here is not that all of this is obviously a personal choice, but that the choice is always already made. Whichever side of the divide you happen to find yourself on, the other side will hold no appeal, apart from the intermittent worry that the grass might be greener over there. But there is no outside vantage point from which to make an unbiased choice, so the question of whether you did indeed chose correctly becomes a moot point. </p>
