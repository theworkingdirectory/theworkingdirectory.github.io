<p><b>Book miniatures: Graves, <i>I, Claudius</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Earlier this week, I went to Boston to visit the MFA. My favourite gallery is located at the very end of the Greek and Roman wing and contains some works by Cy Twombly, a 20th century American artist who I’d vaguely categorize as a post-abstract expressionist. Twombly worked in various media, but is best known for his signature paintings: huge white canvases covered in scribbles, in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of the walls of a middle school bathroom. He has a very distinctive style. The reason you can find his work in the Greek and Roman section is that he had a lifelong fascination with classical antiquity, even producing a cycle of 12 paintings (or scribbles) based on the Iliad (not on display at the MFA – I recently saw it at the Philadelphia Museum of Art).</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The MFA is largely organized based on geographical and chronological principles, rather than artistic influence, so exhibiting Twombly’s work among antique marble statues, pottery and coins is a somewhat unusual choice. What makes it particularly odd is that the gallery isn’t marked on the map, nor is there any signage leading to it. Even devoted Twombly fans would never know it was there unless they were also really into ancient Greece and Rome. On the flip side, the only visitors who do make it to the Twombly gallery are the occasional hardcore antiquity geeks who wander in, stare bewildered at the scribbled canvases (note that the artistic influence in question isn’t exactly obvious) and leave immediately. I will admit that this is one very minor reason why I love this gallery so much.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The main reasons, however, are that I love Twombly, I love classical antiquity, and displaying the two together is a stroke of genius, however odd. For one thing, it makes me see Twombly in a different light. There is a tendency, or I have a tendency, to think of modern art as just sort of arising out of the blue in the 20th century as a rejection of everything that came before. Twombly, the prototypical my-child-could-do-this artist, being inspired by classical antiquity, the most traditional of all artistic traditions that we have in the West, completely undermines this idea. But the gallery also changes how I feel about classical antiquity, which brings us to the topic of today’s post.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>I, Claudius</i> is a fictional autobiography by the eponymous Roman emperor, starting a few years before his birth during Augustus’s reign and ending with his own elevation to the purple. (There is a sequel, which I will probably skip.) Claudius is an interesting figure in many ways: suffering from various disabilities and chronic health conditions, regarded as an imbecile for most of his life, surviving the carnage under Tiberius and Caligula largely because of his presumed imbecility, arriving at power by accident, and then, to everyone’s surprise, emerging as a competent emperor. He is a sympathetic figure, at least from Graves’s perspective, and <i>I, Claudius</i> is an easy read (which I don’t mean in a bad way), witty, charming, the kind of book you’d want to read before going to sleep. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Which is, when you think about it, a bit strange. The early Julio-Claudian dynasty is not intrinsically the stuff for bedtime reading, but would rather make for a unsettling tale about the corrupting power of power, with political enemies dying in their droves. Of course people also read murder mysteries in bed, but <i>I, Claudius</i> is at least on some level history, not fiction, and this makes a difference. I don’t mean to imply that there’s anything morally wrong with the book, its author or its readers, but I’m starting to feel dissatisfied with the perspective on classical antiquity that it offers, which I had thoroughly enjoyed until now: perhaps not sanitized, but still rendering what might be shocking as inoffensive, turning it into something titillating, witty, charming. Isn’t it <i>fun</i> how Livia killed another of her grandsons. <i>I, Claudius</i> is basically <i>Game of Thrones</i> for people who want to feel educated. What makes Twombly so interesting is that he seems to have viewed the Greeks and Romans very differently, as people living in a time that was raw, immediate and brutal with immense bloodshed. It wasn’t fun or charming or anything of that kind. Again, my dissatisfaction with Graves et al. is not moral, but aesthetic. I’m just tired using classical antiquity as my regressive pleasure dome. </p>
