<p><b>Book miniatures: Latronico, <i>Le Perfezioni</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’m not entirely sure if I should call this a novel. There isn’t much of a plot, and there are hardly any protagonists, or rather, the protagonists hardly qualify as such. However, assuming that it is a novel, it would be about Anna and Tom, an Italian couple in their twenties who work in the creative sector and live in Berlin in the early 2010s. Their community consists of expats from across Europe, all of whom have similar resumes. For all of them, living in Berlin is their main job. If you’ve ever lived in Berlin, and probably even if you haven’t, this community is familiar. Throughout the book, Latronico’s style is non-narrative: time doesn’t flow but is presented in a series of stagnant tableaux; protagonists are not protagonists but mannequins modelling a lifestyle, a culture, a moral dilemma. Nothing in particular happens to Anna and Tom, other than eventually moving to Lisbon and then to Italy, where they continue to lead largely the same lifestyle as before. They work from home or from coffee shops. They go out or host dinner parties. They buy houseplants. They use social media.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I’m not entirely sure if I liked this book. It’s not that I have any issue with its tendencies towards non-novel-hood, which are genuinely compelling and skillfully done. Latronico is a very interesting writer. But he’s somehow not a particularly interesting thinker. Most of <i>Le Perfezioni</i>, content-wise, boils down to a standard <i>New Yorker</i> article about the liberal, cosmopolitan elite being disconnected from the average blue-collar guy in the streets in a way that feels vaguely problematic, and also, there’s phones. I don’t disagree, but I do hate it anyway. As Adorno writes, who I feel would have agreed with my sentiment: </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Dem Kulturkritiker paßt die Kultur nicht, der einzig er das Unbehagen an ihr verdankt. Er redet, als verträte er sei’s ungeschmälerte Natur, sei’s einen höheren geschichtlichen Zustand und ist doch notwendig vom gleichen Wesen wie das, worüber er erhaben sich dünkt.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>The cultural critic does not like the culture to which alone he owes his discontent. He speaks as if he represented either pure nature or some higher historical state, yet he is necessarily of the same nature as that to which he considers himself superior.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Le Perfezioni</i>, even if it never turns into a malicious satire that just makes fun of its protagonists, puts Anna and Tom’s life in front of us and invites us to have an opinion about it. Is the right kind of life to lead?, it asks. But this is precisely the question that Anna and Tom ask themselves all the time, the question that causes their misery. Do they have the right coffee table? Is this the right club to go to? Do they have the right kind of sex? We end up judging Anna and Tom judging themselves, and now I judge myself for judging Anna and Tom judging themselves. Is there any way out?  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Quoting DFW:  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship – be it J.C. or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical principles – is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It’s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. Worship power, and you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>As so often, DFW is being very much a product of the nineties, in a kind of adorable way. Those were the good old days when people thought that worshipping material possessions, looks, intelligence, etc., would make you miserable. But what really, truly eats you alive, I’d venture, is worshipping happiness, fulfilment, the good life. Is this the right kind of emotion to have. Is this happy enough. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Last night, I went to an ecstatic dance where I spent the first half desperately trying to enjoy myself, with moderate success. Am I doing this right. Is this fun enough. At some point, I intermittently entertained the possibility of being mildly interested in some guy in my vicinity and decided to try my best to impress him. Suddenly, I had a blast. I changed my mind about the guy. (I’m not sure he noticed me.) As soon as I had a pointless goal to pursue other than having a good time, I felt great. And an outstanding reason for committing yourself to the single-minded pursuit of power, prestige, knowledge, money, beauty, sex and every other pointless ambition that humanity has ever come up with is that it might keep you from pondering, at least for a while, the question whether this is indeed the best possible life you could be leading right now.</p>
