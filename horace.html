<p><b>Book miniatures: Horace, <i>Carmina (vol. I)</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I had always thought of Horace as the sort of poet whose chief interests lie in wine, women and, broadly speaking, entertainment. This isn’t entirely wrong. Horace’s attitude can be almost aggressively anacreontic, and he revels in his reputation as an apolitical hedonist who should probably be a good Roman citizen doing his bit for the Augusto-Maecenean propaganda machine and praise the princeps’ glorious exploits in battle, but who would much rather just have another drink with his friends and praise the beauty of a particularly alluring prostitute. When he does branch out into politics – as in one of the last poems which recounts with obvious relish the final dramatic scenes of the recent civil war, especially the juicy details of Cleopatra’s downfall –, he still seems to be having too much fun to come across as the kind of insufferable sycophant that I always feel Virgil was. All of which is of course as much a persona as anything else, but at least it is a fairly endearing one. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This was my first post-college foray into Roman poetry, and I realized that I had forgotten how  much of it is occasional poetry, composed for a particular event and a particular audience. Horace writes poems celebrating the recent marriage of a friend, mourning the untimely death of another, and praying to the gods to protect another on a forthcoming voyage. Since the Romantics, poetry is seen as introspective, intimate, bordering on self-indulgent. Today's prototypical poet sits alone in a room and writes either for their own private amusement and self-improvement or for an anonymous posterity. But Graeco-Roman poets seem to have written mainly for their friends, and their poetry was a fundamentally social activity. The Odes aren’t just about parties, they <i>are</i> the party. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So it’s all fun and games, except when it’s not. An inescapable presence in Horace’s work are the gods, who must be constantly supplicated and appeased lest they should decide to wreak havoc on Rome. The ode that has stayed with me the most is number 34: <i>Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens...</i> Horace, who admits to having been lax in his devotion to the gods in the past, is suddenly shaken out of his semi-atheistic complacency when he hears the sound of thunder in a cloudless sky. Thunder, traditionally attributed to Jupiter, had recently been argued by the Epicureans to be simply the result of natural forces, viz., the collision of clouds. But if thunder can be heard even in the absence of clouds, Horace realizes, the earth might ruled by the gods after all. It seems such a deeply scary thought to have that should turn your world upside down. What if you are indeed at the mercy of greater forces, neither particularly rational nor particularly benevolent, and all you can do is prostrate yourself at their feet and hope that they will relent? But then isn’t this what we’re all doing anyway? </p>
