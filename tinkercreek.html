<p><b>Book miniatures: Dillard, <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>In her late twenties, Dillard lived alone by Tinker Creek in a remote part of Virginia, spending much of her time roaming the countryside and observing the flora and fauna around her. <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i> is the book that came out of this period. It was my first excursion (no pun intended) into nature writing, which for very natural reasons (sorry) has not been one of my go-to genres so far. My outdoor adventures are largely confined to working in our backyard or reading in the park, I know few, if any, names of species, whether flora or fauna, I have little intention of learning them, and whenever I go to a natural history museum I can muster little more than superficial enjoyment. As mentioned in a previous post, I have a hard time getting excited about pebbles. Dillard’s writing is undoubtedly impressive, but I initially found her minute descriptions of bugs and bees and birds, beautiful though they may be, bordering on tedious. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But then halfway through the book Dillard makes a surprising confession. She often collects water from the creek and examines it under a microscope, but most of the time, we learn, she does not enjoy the experience. It is tedious. Her obsessive drive to observe nature is not pure pleasure for the sake of it, it is a moral exercise. For Dillard, the richness of the world around her is so extraordinary that she feels a responsibility to be attentive to it, to bear witness. <i>I want to have things as multiply and intricately as possible present in my mind.</i> She struggles with being present without collapsing into a self-conscious spiral: <i>I wonder if we do not waste most of our energy just by spending every waking minute saying hello to ourselves.</i> Repeatedly, she deplores the fact that on her outings, many details escape her attention simply because she is ignorant of so many species, behaviors, secrets of the natural world. And all of this I can understand. Of course pebbles are tedious. They won’t suddenly become fun on their own. The point is that it is imperative to attend to them nonetheless. <i>Beauty is real. I would never deny it; the appalling thing is that I forget it.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And fun is not the right word for it anyway. In <i>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</i>, nature is more often deeply disturbing. Dillard is fascinated by cruelty: a giant water bug literally sucking a frog out of its skin; a wasp forcing a bee to vomit honey while squeezing it to death. Parasites eating their hosts, parents eating their offspring, offspring eating their parents. Every living being, including humans, is almost constantly nibbled on by another living being. But it is not only death and destruction that are terrifying; fecundity is too. The fact that everything exists so many times. It’s like the way that food becomes gross when there’s too much of it, even before it spoils. The sheer abundance of life, the relentless cycle of procreation and decay. <i>It is not one pine I see, but a thousand. I myself am not one, but legion. And we are all going to die.</i> There is just too much of everything; everything is full of immeasurable details, and it is all absolutely gratuitous. <i>There the twin oceans of beauty and horror meet.</i> </p>
