<p><b>Book miniatures: de Hamel, <i>Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>So. Much. Fun! Here’s to a 550-page journey through the world of medieval manuscripts, full of sparkling illuminations, barely legible Gothic script, richly decorated initials, mysterious pencil notes left in the margins by previous owners, parchment patched up by incompetent conservators, corners devoured by rats, missing pages, missing provenances, and as much history as can possibly fit between two covers. De Hamel is an absolutely charming guy (provided you overlook some slightly unfortunate comments about the primitive state of the modern Ethiopian church) who stumbles through European libraries, grumbles at the obligatory gloves for handling manuscripts, and always seems to have a whale of a time. He delves into the secret history of the manuscripts with the fervour of an overzealous private detective and the expertise of a tenured professor (he is neither). The book ends with a call for new recruits to the field. I am very tempted to take de Hamel up on the offer. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>As mentioned in an earlier post, I don’t usually fetishize books as material objects, partly because there are just so many of them. If something is as ubiquitous as text is nowadays, there is no point in erecting a shrine for it. This is a shame, though. I get as excited as de Hamel does about medieval manuscripts (or at least almost – his enthusiasm is hard to match) because it means you can point to a single, medium-sized object and say, this is it. This is writing, this is culture, this is art. This is valuable, and if it did not exist, the world wouldn’t be the same. Every single book (and blog post!) contains a tiny spark of that, but it can be difficult to see.  </p>
