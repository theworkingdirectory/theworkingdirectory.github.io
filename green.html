<p><b>Book miniatures: Green, <i>The Anthropocene Reviewed</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>This was recommended to me by a friend. I liked it, but I don’t have much to say about it as a whole, so I’m going to concentrate on one chapter.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Every now and then I realize that an experience that I thought was unique to me is actually a well-established phenomenon that even has its own name. <i>Oh, other people have this too. This is a thing.</i> I had such an epiphany while reading John Green’s <i>The Anthropocene Reviewed</i>, which is a collection of short essays on a wild variety of topics in the natural and social world, from velociraptors to air conditioning to <i>Super Mario Kart</i>. One of these essays is devoted to what I have now learned is called the yips. The yips are a bit like writer’s block for athletes. It’s when, in a high-pressure situation, you’re suddenly unable to perform a movement that you’re normally perfectly comfortable with. According to Wikipedia, it seems to affect mainly, but not exclusively, tennis players and golfers. While there have been prominent cases of professional athletes being struck by the yips, it is also a common experience among amateurs. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I play capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art. A proper game between two capoeiristas (in capoeira, we speak of <i>games</i>, not <i>fights</i>) takes place in a <i>roda</i>, a circle of people singing, clapping and playing music. (There’s a lot of complicated etiquette around this, but that doesn’t matter here.) In my group, every class ends with a <i>roda</i> after our regular practice. So I’m used to being in the <i>roda</i> and it’s not a high-stakes situation, but it does mean playing in front of an audience, which can be a bit daunting. I’ve been playing for a year now and although I’m very decent for my level, I’m strictly a beginner and the most junior member of my group (capoeira-wise, that is). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I can’t remember exactly when I first had the yips, but it must have been quite early. I step into the <i>roda</i> and suddenly ask myself: Can I do this? What if I can’t? Every move that normally comes naturally to me becomes difficult, even the most basic ones. The movements don’t flow. I overthink my next steps, I lose all connection with my partner and it ends up not being a good game. I don’t often get the yips and sometimes not for weeks at a time, but once I do, they can be hard to get rid of. As with panic attacks, worrying about getting the yips means that you probably will get the yips. (None of this is to say that the experience is comparable to a panic attack – it's annoying and frustrating, but I’ve never lost any sleep over it.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>For a long time, I thought I could make the yips go away by just trying very hard not to get them. Not surprisingly, this was unsuccessful, if not counterproductive. It’s only recently that I’ve come up with a strategy that seems to be working. When I enter the <i>roda</i> and sense that I might get the yips, I copy my partner, not necessarily <i>what</i> they do but rather <i>how</i> they do it. Their speed, how wide their <i>ginga</i> is, how tight or loose they keep their core, how they move their arms. What this does, for one, is that it takes your attention away from yourself and what you’re going to do next, and onto your partner and what they’re doing right now. You can’t obsess about whether your next move will work if you’re busy tracking someone else. Copying your partner also breaks your motoric default patterns. You’re moving in a way that you didn’t anticipate, that is in some ways out of your control, and that’s an interesting place to be in. It takes you out of your own head.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In an earlier post on recursion, I wrote about the experience of getting stuck in a spiral of abstraction, and that the only way out of the spiral and to regain a world is to connect with someone else. The yips are such a recursive spiral – you’re monitoring yourself monitoring yourself monitoring yourself <i>ad inf.</i> – and you have to find a person who can get you out of it. Fortunately, in capoeira, you have such a person. Unlike in other martial arts – let alone golf or tennis –, your partner is not your opponent; you’re playing, not fighting. You’re not supposed to hit or hurt or humiliate your partner, but to interact with them in a way that is fun and challenging and looks cool. It’s not a competition. You have the privilege of not having to make this about yourself.  </p>
