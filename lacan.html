<p><b>Book miniatures: Bowie, <i>Lacan</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I was reading Žižek recently (before I started this blog) and realized that my understanding of Lacanian psychoanalysis is somewhat shallower than I would like it to be (and than I thought it was). Since I’m not out of my mind, I settled on a book not by Lacan but about Lacan. I’m not sure that it greatly increased my understanding. The following is more of a general reflection on psychoanalysis at large. I’m quite busy grad-school-wise at the moment, so it’s a short one.</i> </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Psychoanalysis is one of those things that is easy to dismiss outright, and even feels good to dismiss. Its strict non-falsifiability, the blatant misogyny in much of Freud’s and Lacan’s writing, the obscurity of Lacan’s writing, the sheer weirdness of the Oedipus complex, penis envy, the death drive, etc., all make it a deeply unpalatable intellectual exercise for certain kinds of intellects and palates. Judged from the outside, psychoanalysis is about as scientifically respectable as phrenology and weirdly our of sync with the field of psychology as a whole, which is becoming ever more empirical, quantitative and rigorous. I say all of this as a preemptive ‘Yes, I know’ gesture. Yes, I know that psychoanalysis seems ridiculous, but. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>There is a recurring theme in much of psychoanalytic thought that I find striking, and that is the sense of how difficult it is to be a person. The issue here is not the inevitability of suffering, of rejection, failure, loss, illness and death. The difficulty sits deeper, at what I’m tempted to call an ontological level. A person is a very fragile construction, an elaborate illusion that could fall apart at any moment. The challenge is not only to construct an identity that feels authentic and vaguely socially appropriate but, more fundamentally, simply to maintain a minimal degree of internal cohesion, a point from which you can speak in the first person and feel that there is a single person speaking. One is not born a person: one becomes a person, being tasked with separating an inside from the outside despite the fact that the outside constantly and inevitably penetrates the inside, that the inside is nothing but a vessel for the outside. How crazy it is that a lump of flesh and bone could come to say ‘I’ and even believe it.</p> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>And this then also comes with a different way of thinking about mental health. We often talk about mental health in analogy to physical health: health is the norm, and illness is a deviation from the norm, it can only be understood against the background of the norm. Unlike health, illness requires an explanation: you are sick because something happened; you are healthy because nothing happened. The body – and, by analogy, the mind – is at rest in a state of health unless acted upon by a force. In psychoanalysis, on the other hand, being of sound mind is an abnormality, something that requires deliberate upkeep. Madness is the truth. What psychoanalysis seems to be saying is that being a person is strictly speaking impossible; the only reason why most of us manage to do it anyway is because we lie to ourselves so successfully. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>As a postscriptural caveat, I should make it clear that my concern here is with psychoanalytic theory, not practice. I have no experience with or expertise about the latter, and the potential benefits and shortcomings of psychoanalytic treatment are, in a sense, a very different question from Lacanian theory considered in ivory-tower isolation. A few years ago, I met a psychology major at some social event who told me she was planning to train as a psychoanalyst. Displaying my inimitable social skills, I pointed out to her that according to quantitative research, psychoanalysis has a poor track record in treating mental disorders compared to more down-to-earth no-nonsense approaches like CBT. Said psychology major didn’t respond directly, but explained that what she liked about psychoanalysis was that it actually took the patient seriously as a person, as a complex being who cannot be reduced to behavioral patterns that either check or don’t check certain diagnostic boxes. (She didn’t quite put it that way.) This may be true. It may also be true that any attempt to talk about psychoanalysis while ignoring the actual therapeutic process is misguided in the first place. Be that as it may.</i></p>
