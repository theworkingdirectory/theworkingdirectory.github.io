<p><b>Grown-up</b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>My mother is a prototypical middle child, the third out of six. What is worse, the third daughter. The next two were sons. Growing up, my mom was always in between: she wasn’t one of the older girls, who were allowed things that the others weren’t yet; she wasn’t one of the boys, who had all kinds of privileges; and she wasn’t the baby, who also got special treatment. Almost all of her clothes were hand-me-downs from her sisters. She always felt like an afterthought in her family.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I know all of this because my mom likes to talk about it. To this day, she still harbours a huge amount of resentment towards my grandparents. Just to be clear, none of what happened was even remotely on the level of abuse, for all I can tell. But every time my mom tells the story of how she was never allowed to take ballet lessons as a child, it looks like she’s about to cry.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I used to have a fair share of resentment towards my parents as well, also for not even remotely abuse-level reasons. Realizing that my mom acts the same way towards her own parents changed that. On some level, I get why she feels the way she does and I don’t want to judge her for that. But the fact remains that she is a grown-up woman. She has as husband, two kids, a house, she runs a charity, she is in great health, has no financial worries and a zillion friends. In many respects, she is a very conventionally successful person, which raises the question why the hell we’re still talking about those ballet lessons she wasn’t allowed to take fifty years ago. It seems so petty. The fact that she’s still not over it after all these years is just sad, and it made me realize that I don’t want to be like that. This isn’t some grand gesture of forgiving my parents or anything. It’s just that I have more interesting things to get upset about these days.  </p>
