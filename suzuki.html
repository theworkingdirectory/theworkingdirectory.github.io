<p><i>Fun fact: this is number one on Goodreads’ list of the best books on Zen Buddhism of all times, as well as of several other similar rankings. Swarm intelligence does get things right sometimes.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>A friend of mine once told me the following story about a Buddhist monk who is interviewed by a Western journalist about meditation. I can’t fully reconstruct the details, but it went something like this.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>‘Tell me,’ the journalist asks, ‘why do you meditate? Is it to free yourself from stress, anxiety and depression?’</p>
<p>The monk shrugs. ‘I wouldn’t say so.’ </p>
<p>‘Do you meditate to find inner peace and true happiness?’</p>
<p>‘Nah.’</p>
<p>‘So you rather meditate to attain enlightenment and reach nirvana?’</p>
<p>The monk, mildly amazed: ‘Not really.’</p>
<p>The journalist, exasperated: ‘Then why? Why do you meditate?’</p>
<p>The monk ponders for a moment. </p>
<p>‘I suppose I just like the silence.’</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>I had an on-off meditation practice for about the last six years. A couple of weeks ago, I quit. Every time I had lost my meditation streak in the past, I had always had the intention to get back to it, as soon as I had the time, as soon as things calmed down, as soon as I could muster the willpower. I never really gave up on the idea that meditation was this fundamentally good thing that I genuinely wanted to do even if I wasn’t feeling up to it on a particular day. Until that point I hit recently when a regular meditation practice suddenly didn’t only seem hard to achieve, but just not a particularly worthwhile goal to pursue. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>One of the points that <i>Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind</i> makes over and over again is that meditation is just not a goal to pursue in the first place. <i>In zazen what you are doing is not for the sake of anything.</i> Meditation is the one thing that is truly an end in itself. Whatever you aim to achieve through meditation you will not achieve. <i>Our effort in our practice should be directed from achievement to non-achievement.</i> You just sit because you sit, or at best because you like the silence. The hardest thing about meditation is not sitting for long periods in an uncomfortable position or focusing on your breath or even letting go of your thoughts. The hardest thing is doing all of this for absolutely no reason, and yet doing it for no reason at all is the only good reason why you would ever want to do it in the first place. </p>
