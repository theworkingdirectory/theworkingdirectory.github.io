<p><b>Book miniatures: Ferrante, <i>Storia del nuovo cognome</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Spoilers ahead.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Storia del nuovo cognome</i> is the second of Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels and continues the story of Elena (or Lenù) and her part-time best friend and full-time rival Lila. Having grown up in the same poor neighbourhood of Naples, the two girls have taken opposite paths in life: while Lenù excels at school, goes on to study in Pisa and eventually enjoys some first modest successes as a writer, Lila finds herself trapped in a materially advantageous but abusive marriage, falls in love with another man, becomes pregnant, leaves her husband for her lover, who abandons her shortly afterwards, returns to her husband, becomes the center of various quarrels, intrigues and tragedies, and finally leaves everything – her husband, her neighbourhood, her former life – for good, barely making ends meet by working in a sausage factory. Lila is a character in a novel, hyperbolic in every respect, but Lenù – who, not coincidentally, has the same name as Ferrante herself – feels like a real, mildly interesting person you might know. Whenever Lenù, the narrator, tells us about a period in her life in which Lila does not appear, it is like watching a documentary inserted into a feature film. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>As in the first novel, <i>L’amica geniale</i>, the heart of the story is the relationship between Lenù and Lila. Despite all her achievements in life, Lenù is forever comparing herself to Lila, who has always been more brilliant, more beautiful, more <i>everything</i> than Lenù. But in <i>Storia del nuovo cognome</i> we begin to understand that Lila is also constantly comparing herself to Lenù, watching her succeed while her own life unravels. At times Lila seems defeated, her relentless drive extinguished. And yet, in the end she has a new passion, a new man, she has a child; she is not defeated. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Nevertheless, the question remains why Lila, the more talented of the two, keeps failing where Lenù succeeds. The simple answer is class. Lila’s family is poorer than Lenù’s and cannot afford any education beyond elementary school. If the two girls had started life with equal opportunities, one might reason, if the society they grew up in was truly meritocratic, Lila would have won. There is some truth to this, but things are more complicated. Rather, doesn’t Lila fail precisely because she is brilliant, more brilliant than people can handle? Lenù is good but in a docile, unassuming, non-threatening way. Lila is an unruly force of nature who upsets and offends everyone around her. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Or, alternatively, is Lila just making the wrong choices? (Is it all about individual responsibility after all?) At the end of the first volume, when Lila realizes that her decision to marry Stefano, a wealthy and seemingly reliable businessman from the neighbourhood, was a mistake, it seemed that her mistake was to choose money, the immediate satisfaction of material desires, over education. But in the second volume, the man she falls for is Nino Sarratore, an aspiring intellectual who Lenù has been in love with for a long time, and Lila does eventually rediscover her love for reading, writing and learning, and yet she fails again. Perhaps Lila’s original sin is not that she bets on the wrong man but that she bets, and keeps betting, on any man. In contrast, the people that Lenù relies on are older women: teachers, mentors, publishers. From her lovers, she keeps a careful distance.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But then it might also be that the original question was misplaced altogether and that Lila never fails and Lenù never wins. Lila’s love affair with Nino is brief and ultimately disastrous but it is intense, and she gives herself completely to it. Lenù, as both girls know, has never experienced and might never experience anything like this. She plays it safe. She plays: that is the right word. Lenù playacts her life, pretending to be modest, to be smart, to be docile, to be radical, to be whatever person she is required to be in a given moment. At university, she is a poster child for first-gen impostor syndrome. And it isn’t only her: in the seemingly glamorous intellectual circles she enters, all talk about politics, literature, philosophy is mere playacting, aimed at showing off one’s cultural capital. There is a sense of disillusionment here that may be familiar to anyone who grew up intellectually in a liberal arts environment and then grew out of it. In the neighbourhood, people brag about the cars they drive; at university, they brag about the books they’ve read. It’s all the same, there’s nothing deeper to it. Neither Lenù nor Lila realize that even Nino is not actually a particularly profound or interesting person. Once you take away everything he’s read, Lila says in an early moment of clarity that is soon forgotten, there’s nothing left. Lenù’s life, like perhaps the life of any real person, is always on the verge of disappointment and disenchantment.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Towards the very end of the novel, Lenù goes to see Lila for the first time in years, finally feeling confident and superior. But what Lila tells her without saying, she senses, is <i>che non avevo vinto niente, che al mondo non c’era alcunché da vincere</i>: that I hadn’t won anything, that there was nothing to win in the world. Maybe it’s not a competition after all? It’s a nice thought, but I don’t see it yet; it may be waiting in the next volume. </p>
