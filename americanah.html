<p><b>Book miniatures: Adichie, <i>Americanah</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I’d like to make a general comment about these book miniatures, which is that they’re not really meant to be reviews. I occasionally complain about books that don’t meet the standards they set themselves (Coates is a good example), but I’m ultimately not really interested in passing judgement on the texts as such. I pretty much pass judgement on stuff for a living and it’s nice to occasionally get to take a break from that. I’m interested in what the text does and how I respond to that, and while it happens fairly frequently that the text doesn’t really resonate with me, there’s no particular reason to blame the text rather than myself, in the same way that there’s no reason to blame people you don’t click with for being non-clickable. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The reason for this preface is that <i>Americanah</i> is one of those books where I felt a strong disconnect between what the text quote-unquote objectively achieves and how I reacted to it. For all intents and purposes, it is a very well-behaved novel with great executive functioning. The most miniature-sized summary I could come up with is that it tells the story of a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, who moves to the US for college and only returns many years later. It is a story of migration and re-migration, of what it means to be Black in America, of what it means to be Americanized in Nigeria, of what it means to be away from home, and of what home is anyway. If I were a serious person with a serious blog, I would write about all of those things, and they deserve to be written about (but then also, obviously, they have been). </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Despite all of that, I found myself mildly but persistently annoyed while reading <i>Americanah</i>, which is really not the book’s fault, or Adichie’s, for that matter. If anything, it’s mine. Because the reason I found this book annoying is that it constantly talks about race, and I’m tired of hearing about race. I agree with everything that <i>Americanah</i> has to say, and I don’t want Adichie to stop writing about race, but the fact remains that I’m tired. And what becomes clearer and clearer over the course of the novel is that Ifemelu is also tired of talking about race, as is Adichie, as is everyone else in this country, Black and White, and I’m tired of living in this country where everyone has to talk about race all the time, and not because it’s some irrational obsession that people happen to indulge in but because it’s genuinely impossible to live in this country without talking about race. It’s not my fault; it’s not Adichie’s. It’s America’s. I don’t really have anything more substantial to say than that. </p>
