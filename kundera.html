<p><b>Book miniatures: Kundera, <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> is a Czech novel about three overlapping couples – Tereza and Tomáš, Tomáš and Sabina, Sabina and Franz. There is little point in summarizing the plot (and I’m admittedly too lazy to do so); in short, life happens. It is not a novel that wants to distinguish itself through its plot. It wants to be a novel about life itself, about what it is like to exist as a human being in this world. It wants to be poetic, elegiac, philosophical. If each life happens only once, the novel asks, does it not become fleeting, ephemeral, unbearably light, as if it hardly happened at all? What if there is nothing to hold onto? </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But it is also a novel about some very specific people in Czechoslovakia during the 1960s and 1970s. Tomáš is a surgeon, a highly educated intellectual and a perpetual womanizer. Tereza comes from a more modest background, tends bars, occasionally works as a photographer, but is mostly occupied with loving Tomáš, who she wants to hold on to by any means. His infidelity is a constant source of anxiety for her. And so Kundera’s Nietzsche-inspired concepts of the lightness and heaviness of being just seem to boil down to attachment type theory, about seeking out and avoiding commitment, and all of this in a stereotypically gendered way. I mentioned in an earlier post that I’m not easily bothered by misogyny, and <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> is not at all particularly outrageous in this respect, but the fact that it tries so hard to be timeless makes its obvious roots in a very specific worldview where women want to settle down and men want to be free a bit jarring. Being timeless is hard. It’s a beautiful novel in many ways; it’s just guilty by association with a contemporary discourse I happen to particularly dislike.
