<p><b>Book miniatures: Gibran, <i>The Prophet</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>A couple of years ago, I heard about the following experiment in a psychology lecture. A group of college students are invited to each pick a free print to decorate their dorm room with. The two options are a Garfield comic and a Monet painting. The subjects are split into two groups, test and control. The test group has to explain their choice of print in writing; the control group doesn’t. A few weeks later, the subjects are asked whether they feel that they made the right choice. The students in the test group turn out to be more likely to regret which print they picked, indicating that, somewhat counterintuitively, explicit deliberation can lead to wore decisions. The professor giving the lecture suggested a particular interpretation as to why forcing subjects to verbalize their thought process might have affected their judgment. It is much easier to explain why you might enjoy having a Garfield comic in your dorm room (it’s funny, it will cheer me up, I’ve always liked Garfield, it could be a conversation starter…). It is difficult to verbalize anything about a Monet painting. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Which of course gets us to the topic of today’s post. Verbalizing about <i>The Prophet</i> is also difficult, and I suspect that this makes me like it less. One of the few downsides of writing these book miniatures is that sometimes I feel under pressure to come up with something meaningful or at least remotely interesting to say about whatever I’m reading, and when I feel I can’t, I tend to blame the book while also blaming myself for blaming the book for something for which I should really blame myself. On these occasions, I usually end up writing some sort of semi-apologetic meta-post about the impossibility of posting, which then sometimes turns into a meta-meta-post in which I ironically refer to my excessive habit of meta- (and meta-meta-)posting, all of which really isn’t remotely as funny as I like to think it is. I suspect that a way out of this predicament would be to take these book miniatures beyond the kind of standard conceptual dissection that I usually indulge in, which some books just don’t lend themselves very well to. And to end on today’s gratuitous quote, from <i>The Prophet</i> itself: <i>You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts</i>.
