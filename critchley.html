<p><b>Book miniatures: Critchley, <i>Mysticism</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>I picked up this book for very random reasons, and I’m not entirely sure I don’t regret it.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Critchley is a philosophy professor somewhere who works broadly in the continental tradition, with a focus on Heidegger. <i>Mysticism</i> is a book about mysticism. One reason why I moderately disliked it is that Critchley’s writing style reminded me of my own to an uncanny extent. Be that as it may, Critchley is interested in mysticism as an alternative mode of thinking, feeling and living, something opposed to the rational, technocratic, dogmatic spirit that reigns in academic philosophy as well as contemporary discourse at large, and which he believes is making us all very miserable. (Something else I dislike: people who diagnose their present time with some sort of existential malaise that is somehow perfectly novel and distinctive to this time, and for which they alone have a remedy. I’m sorry that Critchley is depressed, but I prefer people who use the singular when they speak in the first person, just that now that I think about it, I use the plural quite frequently myself, so just ignore me.) The picture of the mystical experience that emerges from the book is largely apophatic – it’s not this, it’s not that –, which I’m not unsympathetic to, but to read three hundred pages in which the author talks about how he can’t talk about what the book is supposed to be about does get a bit tedious at some point.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Anyway. Part of the appeal that mysticism holds (for Critchley, for many) is that it promises to dissolve the self, to allow us to become one with God or the world or some other sort of prime divinity. And Critchley struggles with his self. He cites Flannery O’Connor (whoever that was): <i>I do not know You God because I am in the way. Please help me to push myself aside.</i> However, as Critchley points out, there is an odd tension here in that mysticism, with all its self-effacing tendencies, is also a genre of writing, and writing requires a writer, a voice, a first person singular, a self. It is impossible to write without creating a persona that always feels in some sense at odds with one’s underlying truth, but Critchley craves authenticity. He writes:</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p><i>Fraudulent feeling is currently the most traded global commodity: thoughts and prayers, thoughts and prayers. To wish for relief from immense suffering is unquestionable [...]. But to articulate such sentiment is much harder without falling into illusory feeling, where we appear to care so much, but actually experience nothing but an abstract moral superiority.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>In a particularly awkward passage, Critchley describes visiting an old church in East Anglia a few years ago to recite (by himself) a T.S. Eliot poem that is somehow connected to the place, all of which appears to have been a profound spiritual experience. He concludes: ‘I then left quietly.’ It’s cringe-worthy as hell, not that he did it, but the way he talks about it. (Again, it reminds me uncomfortably of myself.)</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So the self is awkward, uncomfortable, in the way. But if it is impossible to escape, which it is, then here’s the solution: to stop trying. Not to push the self aside and shrink it to the point where it disappears, but to welcome more and more into the self, make it richer, let it grow, until it encompasses the whole world. Maybe God will want to become one with you.</p>
