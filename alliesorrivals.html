<p><b>Book miniatures: Garfield and Westerhoff (ed.), <i>Madhyamaka and Yogācāra: Allies Or Rivals?</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>Just a heads up that my understanding of all this is very limited and probably faulty at times. No apologies, though.</i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>Madhyamaka and Yogācāra are the two major branches of Mahāyāna Buddhism. The contributions to Garfield and Westerhoff’s edited volume explore the relationship between the two schools, which often overlap as much as they disagree with each other. Both take as their starting point the notion of non-self as developed in the Mahāyāna tradition, which denies inherent existence to what is conventionally deemed reality. In doing so, both aim to strike a balance between nihilism and reificationism, between interpreting non-self too radically and not interpreting it radically enough. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The Madhyamaka interpretation of non-self is quite straightforward: absolutely nothing exists ultimately; everything exists only by convention. Yogācāra takes issue with this view on two grounds. First, Madhyamaka collapses into nihilism by denying an ontological basis for convention. This contrasts with the Yogācāra view, according to which ultimate existence is truthfully predicated in two ways: of a transcendent, ineffable absolute reality that can only be experienced through meditation, and of experience itself. That is, the experience of an apple is real, even though the apple itself is not. Secondly, insofar as Madhyamaka attributes even conventional existence to the apple, Yogācāra also accuses it of reificationism. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>So what are the criteria for true, ultimate existence? In short, something can be said to exist ultimately if it resists analysis. For instance, a chair can be decomposed into legs, a seat and a back, none of which instantiates chairhood. Ergo, chairs do not exist ultimately (according to both Madhyamaka and Yogācāra), although they can still be said to exist conventionally (according to Madhyamaka). The reason why experience itself exists ultimately, according to Yogācāra, is that it cannot be decomposed into an experiencer, an experiencee and an action or event of experience itself; rather, in a Husserlian fashion, the three are analyzed as an inseparable whole. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But Madhyamaka has a way of countering this argument. To take a step back for a moment, the kind of analytical decomposition that we are concerned with here involves Pāṇini’s concept of <i>kārakas</i>, the earliest theory of what in contemporary linguistics are called thematic roles. (And yes, this connects to my dissertation! I got extremely excited about this and need to read more.) Very roughly, many verbal events – killings, cuttings, eatings, etc. – require two participants who can be described as the agent and the undergoer of the action, respectively. If Arjuna eats an apple, then Arjuna is the agent of the eating and the apple is the undergoer. The point that Yogācāra seems to make is that events of perception – or at least events of self-consciousness, I didn’t get entirely clear about this – cannot be decomposed into <i>kārakas</i> in the same way. However, Madhyamaka asks, what does this prove? It just shows that you have concocted an idea that isn’t even amenable to the conceptual framework you commit yourself to by virtue of the very fact that you express yourself in language. In other words, stipulating some ultimate reality that cannot even be referred to in syntactically licit sentences just begs the question.</p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>One of the papers in the book summarizes the respective positions of the Yogācāra and Madhyamaka schools as <i>What exists is ineffable</i> and <i>What is ineffable cannot be said to exist</i>. But what is the difference, Jonathan Gold asks in another paper, between saying that there is no ultimate, and saying that whatever can be said is not the ultimate? Does Madhyamaka assert that what we think of as the ultimate is not the ultimate, or that there is no real ultimate? If the former, Madhyamaka makes essentially the same point as Yogācāra, viz., that the ultimate is not amenable to language and standard cognitive concepts. In the latter case, however, Madhyamaka has fallen into the self-referential trap that most scepticists are caught in at some point: by denying existence to the ultimate, it has effectively reified it, saying that there is an ultimate that does not exist. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>However, this does not seem to be a good-faith interpretation of the Madhyamaka view. Nāgārjuna always made it very clear that non-existence is just as much an illusion as existence. Madhyamaka is not nihilist because nihilism is still a theory about what the world is like, about what exists and what doesn’t. Madhyamaka is not yet another metaphysical theory, but rather an attempt to put an end to metaphysical theorizing once and for all. Rather than elevating emptiness to the status of ultimate truth, it posits that the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth at all. (I think I’m quoting this from one of the papers. Sorry. I did not keep proper track of my sources in this post and have probably plagiarized some people somewhere.)</p>
