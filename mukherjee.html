<p><b>Book miniatures: Mukherjee, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>There’s no better way to spend a Covid infection than with a book about an even worse disease which you don’t have. It’s another book miniature, but I’m changing the word limit from the original 400 to Not too many. </i></p>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p><i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> is a history of cancer. But Mukherjee, being the good writer that he is, prefers to call it a biography of cancer, trying to make us see the disease not as a disembodied concept but as a concrete, vicious enemy that humanity has been doggedly fighting against for centuries. In the same vein, his take on the historical events that he takes us through is a highly personalized one, a story of people rather than of institutions, policies or discursive structures. He carefully portrays the various physicians, researchers, patients and other heroes engaged in the war against cancer, makes their personalities, hopes, failures and successes front and center, and sprinkles all of this with anecdotes from his own experience as a practicing oncologist. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>This is all perfectly entertaining and endearing, but there is another, more abstract dimension to his book. Cancer research is a poster child for scientific progress. We once were blind but now we see. We have moved from bogus theories and barbaric treatments to an understanding of cancer so complex and fine-grained that it cures an astonishing number of patients and lets Mukherjee’s lay reader eventually get a bit lost in the details of proto-oncogenes, kinase-specific inhibitors, recombinant DNA and all the other wonders of molecular biology. However, progress does not happen smoothly. Throughout the history of cancer, as Mukherjee tells it, two opposing sides emerge and reemerge in different formations. One side wants to enlist science to solve society’s biggest problem, while the other emphasizes the importance of basic research. One side seeks the cure for cancer, and the other maintains that to find a cure, we first must understand the cause. One promotes compassionate use – making drugs widely available as early as possible – in order to save lives, and the other advocates carefully balanced, double-blind studies in order to determine if these drugs are even effective in the first place. One side tries to save humans, the other humanity, and there is a trade-off. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>But breakthroughs happen, painstakingly stacking on top of each other, each adding a few percentage points to a patient’s chance of survival, none being a panacea. As we approach the end of the book, cancer is not altogether defeated but it has gradually and somewhat anticlimactically lost its aura of invincibility. Almost everyone today knows someone who not only had, but survived cancer. As much as further research is and will be needed, the great mystery surrounding cancer is vanishing. Cancer does still frighten us, it still kills, and to some extent it still captures the public imagination (and – footnote – certainly more so than cardiovascular diseases, which kill with spectacular efficiency but seem to fail to capture anything imaginative), but I was left wondering if cancer is still the epochal disease that Sontag wrote about in <i>Illness as Metaphor</i>. I would venture that this role has been passed on to Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Benjamin once wrote that a story cannot truly be told until its protagonist is dead because only death provides the final closure without which a thread is left hanging in the air. It feels like Mukherjee’s biography does adhere to this dictum in a way, for cancer is not dead, but dying. But it may be that the story of cancer will not simply continue to peter out in the future but that the final battle, and the ultimate defeat, are still to come.</p>
