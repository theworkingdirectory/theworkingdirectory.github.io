<p><b>Book miniatures: Nietzsche, <i>Schopenhauer als Erzieher</i> and <i>Wir Philologen</i></b></p>

</div>

<span style="display:block; height: 25px;"></span>

<p>I was a devoted Nietzschean in my twenties. I eventually reached the point where I felt I had somehow exhausted him, but I still identified as a fan. <i>Schopenhauer as an Educator</i> and <i>We Philologists</i> are two essays I had never read, they seemed to connect to some of my special interests, and I figured it might be fun to revisit the idol of my long-gone youth. Reading them ended up curing me of my ongoing infatuation with Nietzsche.  </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>The two essays deal with philosophy and philology, respectively. Nietzsche is interested in them not so much as fields of research devoted to the pursuit of disinterested knowledge but rather as a pedagogical enterprise that helps shape the mind of the young man. The young man, I hasten to add, is not just anyone. One of the major problems with the philosophy and philology departments of this day, as Nietzsche sees it, is that they fail to distinguish between the herd, who is incapable of appreciating the lessons that philosophy and philology have to offer, and the true genius, who alone is worthy of them. As any Nietzsche reader knows, the herd is generally just personified collateral damage. Nietzsche writes: <i>die Menschheit soll fortwährend daran arbeiten, einzelne große Menschen zu erzeugen – und dies und nichts anderes ist ihre Aufgabe</i> (humanity should continuously strive to produce great individuals – and this, and nothing else, is its task). Even most professional philosophers and philologists are nothing other than pathetic exemplars of the sheeple; the only worthwhile way for them to spend their lives is to prepare the way for the genius. And who would want to become an academic anyway? It’s a miserable existence, spent in the service of the state, which never allows you to ever have one truly interesting and radical thought of your own. </p>

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Schopenhauer counts among the few exceptions to the rule: grumpy and unsociable, never academically successful, only attracting a sympathetic audience in his later life, defending his philosophy against the whole world. It is easy to see that Nietzsche saw himself in Schopenhauer, and that he considered himself the foremost example of the true genius. Nietzsche, Schopenhauer and perhaps Thoreau are the prototypes of the brilliant, mysterious loner who likes to take long walks alone in the woods and think very deep thoughts and write them down in his very private notebook and who doesn’t <i>want</i> to have any friends anyway because everyone else is such an <i>idiot</i>. Needless to say that both Nietzsche and Schopenhauer tried to have an academic career and that both failed in the most humiliating ways. I don’t mean to be sneery, and these two essays aren’t really representative of Nietzsche’s work as a whole, which I still think is interesting, but this is just pathetic. Worse yet, it’s resentment, which Nietzsche always seemed to hate more than anything else.  </p>
